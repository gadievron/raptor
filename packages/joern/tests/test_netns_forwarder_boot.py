"""Boot-window terminal-signal tests for the netns forwarder script.

The non-pidns boot used to expose two windows to a consumer that
signals early:

* pre-handler: the unix socket appeared on disk (and the group-tier
  ready line fired) before the SIGTERM/SIGINT handlers installed, so
  a signal keyed on either milestone hit the default disposition —
  supervisor dead by signal, socket left behind;
* handlers-installed/child-``None``: the old handler silently dropped
  a terminal signal when no child existed yet, and the subsequent
  ``child.wait()`` then blocked forever (signal absorbed).

These tests pin the fixed contract: the handlers install before any
observable boot milestone, and a terminal signal arriving before the
child exists is honoured (prompt teardown, child never spawned; or
delivery right after the spawn) — never dropped. The child-``None``
window is microseconds wide in a real boot, so the deterministic
window tests drive the forwarder's test-only pre-spawn gate
(RAPTOR_NETNS_FORWARDER_TEST_PRESPAWN_GATE) instead of racing a
sleep; the milestone tests gate their signal on the observable event
itself (socket path exists / ready line read).

Everything here runs the full script in a subprocess with a stub
python child standing in for joern, so it is skipped without
unprivileged user namespaces (same probe as test_netns_forwarder.py).
Kill discipline: every signalled pid is this file's own verified
``Popen`` child, and the last-resort straggler sweep re-reads
``/proc/<pid>/cmdline`` for the test's unique marker path before any
kill — never a pid <= 1, never an unverified pid.
