"""Shared joern test isolation and suite-wide guards.

The heap ledger arbitrates JVM spawns through a HOST-GLOBAL file
under the user's home. Tests must never read or write that file:
a test row would clamp a concurrently-running real analysis (and a
real run's committed heap would flip test grant assertions), and the
grant math must not depend on the CI runner's physical RAM — a
test asserting ``-J-Xmx16384m`` in a spawn argv would fail on any
runner with less RAM than the asserted heap.

Tripwire: no test may leave a ``JoernServer`` handle aimed at a
sentinel pid/pgid (≤ 1) alive. ``JoernServer.__del__`` runs the REAL
``stop()`` at GC time — after the test's monkeypatches are undone —
and ``killpg(1, sig)`` is ``kill(-1, sig)`` at the kernel: a broadcast
to every process this uid can signal. A fabricated handle with
``_pgid = 1`` did exactly that once, SIGTERMing every same-uid
process on the host each time the file ran. The product guards now
refuse pgid ≤ 1, but the suite must never rely on them: any offender
is defused in place (so its eventual finalizer is a no-op even on a
regressed tree) and the test that built it fails by name.

The same sweep silently defuses every leaked server whose ``_proc``
is a test double rather than a real ``subprocess.Popen``. Doubles
routinely outlive their test inside reference cycles (a MagicMock
proc alone is one), so their destruction waits for the cyclic
collector — which can run inside a LATER test's ``patch`` window,
where the deferred ``__del__ -> stop()`` replays against that test's
mocks (a phantom ``_ensure_group_dead`` call was the observed shape).
Real-process handles keep their finalizer: for those, GC-time
``stop()`` is live cleanup, not replay.
