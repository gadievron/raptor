"""Worker threads must block the handled terminal signals.

``main()`` installs Python-level SIGTERM/SIGINT handlers and then
blocks in ``child.wait()``. A process-directed terminal signal the
kernel routes to a worker thread (accept loop, connection pumps,
orphan watchdog) only trips CPython's C-level flag — the Python
handler waits for the main thread, whose waitpid is never
interrupted, so the stop request is silently absorbed until the
child dies on its own. The shield (``_start_signal_shielded``)
blocks exactly the handled signals in every worker so kernel
delivery lands on the main thread and unwedges the wait promptly.

These tests pin the observable invariant via ``/proc/self/task``
(SigBlk is per-thread), in-process — no namespaces, no subprocess.
