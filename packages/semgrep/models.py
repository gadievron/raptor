# so the summary must stay bounded regardless of input. The caps cut
# both ways:
#   * higher = more of the excluded scope visible on the result, at
#     the cost of result-size / serialised-artifact bloat that the

#   * lower = cheaper results, but the operator loses the ability to
#     see WHICH subtree a skip reason is eating.
# 5 sample paths per reason is enough to recognise the affected
# subtree without retaining the whole list; 12 distinct reasons
# covers semgrep's skip-reason enum (~10 values on 1.172.0) with
# headroom while refusing an unbounded set of fabricated reason
# strings from a damaged payload.
