"""Persistent sandboxed Ghidra server.

Boots ONE pyghidra JVM inside ``core.sandbox.run`` (network denied,
reads restricted to the interpreter/pyghidra/Ghidra-install/work
scopes, writes scoped to the work dir) and serves decompile / apply /
export requests over a unix socket for the lifetime of a run. This is
the JVM-reuse the in-process pyghidra session offers, WITH the
sandbox the in-process path cannot have — many-request consumers
(audit loops decompiling function after function) pay one JVM boot
instead of one per subprocess invocation, on hostile projects.

Two transports, chosen by a boot-time pre-flight
(``check_child_unix_sockets_available``): a pathname unix socket the
worker binds itself (primary — keeps the namespace sandbox lane), or
an inherited socketpair half (``--socket-fd``) on hosts whose sandbox
lane denies ``socket(2)`` to the child (nested sandboxes: the worker
would otherwise die at bind with EPERM). The pre-flight is a
host-level verdict, but the sandbox picks its lane per call — a
per-call demotion can deny ``socket(AF_UNIX)`` even where the
pre-flight said the pathname transport would serve. A pathname boot
that dies at the worker's socket setup with EPERM is therefore
retried ONCE on the socketpair transport (the worker then never
creates a socket), and the denial is memoised for the process so
later boots skip the doomed pathname attempt.

Usage::

    with GhidraServer(gpr_path) as srv:
        srv.open()
        code = srv.decompile("main")
        srv.apply_enrichments({...})

The working copy lives in the server's work dir (the original
project is never modified); ``enriched_gpr`` names the copy for
callers that persist results.
