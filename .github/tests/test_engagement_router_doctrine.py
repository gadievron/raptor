"""Doctrine fence for the cross-artifact hypothesis router.

The router mints hypothesis seed files that steer later audit spend,
and most of its input bytes originate in a hostile target or sibling
run directories. Doctrine rows pinned here, independent of the unit
battery's placement:

  1. **No LLM anywhere near routing** — the router must never import
     an LLM/dispatch/prompt seam, and must not spawn processes or
     open sockets itself (its only subprocess exposure is the sealed
     ELF/identity helpers it calls, which carry their own gates).
  2. **No fence-evading calls** — no dynamic import, code execution,
     or raw file writes; every artifact leaves through the atomic
     ``save_json`` seam.
  3. **One cap, the consumer's** — the routing quota is the intake's
     own ``MAX_SEED_RECORDS``, imported, never a shadow constant that
     could drift from what the consumer actually accepts.
  4. **Saturation escalates** — overflow beyond the quota reaches the
     engagement governor as ``routing_saturated``; it is never only a
     silent drop.
  5. **Quota shares are total and rank-ordered** — every producer
     class has a floor share, the shares never oversubscribe the cap,
     and the strongest class ranks first.
  6. **No unregistered producer class** — the allocator refuses a
     candidate whose class carries no floor share instead of dropping
     it from every counter.

Rows 1–4 are mechanical AST/source proofs (including the ImportFrom
alias, call-of-call, ``os.write``, and ``pkgutil.resolve_name``
evasion shapes); rows 5–6 import the module (stdlib + repo checkout
only — no toolchain, no network).
