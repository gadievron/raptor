"""Seal-time contact gate — 3-tier compose probe over the registry-snapshot roster.

Sealed patch series are reviewed one at a time, but they land TOGETHER.
Between "my series applies clean on main" and "the composed roster is
sound" sit three failure classes that per-series review cannot see:

* two series edit the same region (git conflict markers at compose time);
* two series apply textually clean but break each other semantically
  (a sibling renames a symbol, the consumer's new code still uses the
  old name — an undefined-name error that only exists at the composed
  tree);
* a series composed onto CURRENT main trips a repo-wide census/closure
  gate that was tightened after the series sealed (base drift — no
  sibling series involved at all).

A fourth class needs no compose at all: a seal line's compose/rehearsal
CITATION (naming a sibling series plus the FINAL/TREE sha it rehearsed
against) goes stale when that sibling is recut mid-window — the
rehearsal keeps vouching for content that no longer rides.

This tool mechanises the compose probe as tiers, run against one
scratch composition built from the SAME roster interface the kit
assembler uses — a frozen registry snapshot file — so the gate and the
assembler can never disagree about what composes:

Tier 0 — rehearsal-citation staleness (always on, string-only, runs
    first). Every rostered line's machine-checkable citation
    (``STACK=on-<x>(...,tree-<sha>)``, ``STACKED-ON=patches-<x>(...)``,
    ``BASE=<sha>(=patches-<x>-FINAL...)``) is verified against the
    SAME snapshot: the cited series' current line (rostered, or landed
    with that sha) must carry the cited sha — otherwise STALE
    REHEARSAL, flagged with both lines quoted. Unparseable /
    joint-artifact citation shapes (prose rehearsal notes,
    ``COMPOSED-TREE=<sha>(...)``) surface as notes, never silently.

Tier 1 — roster compose. Apply every rostered series in roster order
    onto the base tip via ``git am -3`` / ``git apply --3way`` (NEVER
    patch(1): patch's fuzz factor silently applies hunks git correctly
    refuses, so a patch(1)-based probe is unsound). A conflict names
    the pair (applying unit x last unit(s) that touched the conflicting
    files). A conflict whose pair is DECLARED — either seal line names
    the other series — defers the unit and keeps composing; an
    UNDECLARED conflict fails the gate.

Tier 2 — composed union ruff. Repo-config ruff over the union of ALL
    applied units' touched .py files at the composed tree (the victim
    file can belong to a sibling, so scanning only the sealing unit's
    own files misses the cross-series break). Findings already present
    at the base tree are subtracted — only composition-introduced
    findings fail.

Tier 3 — composed gate battery. The repo's standing census/closure
    gate set, DERIVED from the workflow definitions at the composed
    tree (never a hand list): every static ``.github/scripts/check_*.py``
    invocation and every static, marker-unconditioned pytest invocation
    found in ``.github/workflows/*.yml`` run blocks. Each derived gate
    runs at the composed tree; a red gate is re-run at the bare base
    (pre-existing red = base rot, warned not charged) and then bisected
    over the per-unit boundary commits to name the introducing unit.

Roster source (the assembler interface): the snapshot's SEALED,
non-superseded, non-landed series lines, in registry order, adjusted by
the declared stack markers (``STACK=on-<x>``, ``STACKED-ON=patches-<x>``,
``BASE=<sha>(=patches-<x>-FINAL...)``) and explicit order constraints
(``LAND-<X>-FIRST``). Directory globs are deliberately NOT an input.
Every non-blank snapshot line gets a categorized adjudication; a SEALED
line that cannot roster is a hard error and any other series-shaped
line matching no known arm is a LOUD note — never a silent bin. The
snapshot is taken as-is (frozen-registry contract): stale SEALED lines
whose units already landed are NOT reconciled cross-line — tier 1
detects them STRUCTURALLY (``git am -3`` exits 0 for already-applied
mails without creating commits, so no-or-fewer commits than the
payload's mails, or an apply that stages nothing on the diff route, is
an already-applied finding; an empty boundary is never committed).
Boundary: a re-addition that git resolves as a legitimately NEW change
(the same content landing again at a different anchor once the
original context drifted) is a genuine tree delta tier 1 cannot
distinguish from intended content — its consequences surface at the
composed tree instead (tier 2 flags duplicate definitions as F811;
tier 3 runs the census battery over the result).

Output contract: human-readable report on stdout; one
``CONTACT-GATE-FINDING: ...`` line per finding and a final
machine-parseable ``CONTACT-GATE: PASS|FAIL ...`` summary line for the
assembler. Exit 0 = clean, 1 = findings, 2 = usage / infrastructure
error (a gate that cannot run must not pass).

Usage:
    python3 .github/scripts/contact_gate.py --snapshot <file> \
        [--repo <path>] [--base <ref>] [--tiers 1,2,3] [--json <file>] \
