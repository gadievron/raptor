"""The graph DB slot must hold a regular file or nothing.

The store's integrity binding is keyed to the graph path's parent
dir, so a symlink planted at the DB name points reads at a foreign
store whose rows still VERIFY, and every write lands on the link
target. Nothing in the pipeline creates the DB as a symlink.
