"""Check-then-use closure on the graph DB slot.

The landed by-name refusal (``test_store_symlink_refusal``) covers a
STEADY-STATE plant. These tests cover the race the by-name check left
open: a swap landing between the slot check and ``sqlite3.connect``'s
own by-name open. The deterministic race hook wraps
``sqlite3.connect`` so the plant lands after every pre-check and
immediately before sqlite opens — the exact TOCTOU window.

Residual stated honestly: sqlite's own fd is unreachable from Python,
so the post-connect witness (``PRAGMA database_list`` inode identity)
catches a lingering swap but cannot catch a swap-in/swap-back pair
that completes entirely within sqlite's open; the WAL/-shm sidecar
names are opened by sqlite by name and carry no guard (unchanged from
the pre-fix posture).
