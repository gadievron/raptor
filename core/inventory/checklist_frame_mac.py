"""HMAC frame authentication for the checklist substrate.

The checklist (single-file ``checklist.json`` or the sharded
``checklist/`` layout) is the inventory every review pipeline walks:
it decides WHICH functions exist to be reviewed. It lives in run and
project directories that are target-writable during runs and
restorable verbatim by ``/project import`` — and its integrity story
was per-shard sha256 alone, which is source CURRENCY, not
authentication: anyone who can write the run directory can replace
the frame wholesale with self-consistent hashes and steer the review
queue. Nothing bound the frame to the slot that created it.

Writers stamp the frame at the single write chokepoint
(``core.inventory._write_checklist_locked``) with an HMAC-SHA256
token over the document's canonical JSON (token excluded), the
on-disk FORM, and the resolved SLOT directory the frame was written
into. For the sharded layout the token rides on ``index.json`` and
covers the manifest — shard name set, per-shard sha256/bytes/counts,
totals, metadata — so shard-content authenticity chains through the
already-verified per-shard sha256. Readers classify every frame into
the journal-MAC tier vocabulary (same trust story and key-handling
discipline as ``core.coverage.journal_mac``):

* ``verified`` — token valid, slot matches: authenticated tier.
* ``tampered`` — token present but invalid: the accessors fail
  closed loudly (read-only consumers degrade to ``{}``; the
  read-modify-write accessor refuses; and every read that feeds a
  re-stamping ``save_checklist`` outside the plain accessor
  round-trip — run-to-project checklist promotion, the Ghidra
  diff-priority boost, and the exploitability-validation pipeline's
  parent-checklist reuse — applies the same gate, so an in-place
  edit is never re-stamped/laundered by any write route).
  Deliberately harsher than the journal's
  unverifiable-demotes-to-unstamped compromise: journal rows are
  irreplaceable history, while a checklist is mechanically
  REBUILDABLE from the target — the refusal remedy is one rebuild.
* ``unstamped`` — no token (pre-MAC legacy, or forged-unstamped):
  legacy tier, accepted with behavior otherwise unchanged so old
  runs keep working; warned once per slot, louder for frames born
  inside the stamp era (:data:`FRAME_MAC_ERA_START` mtime fence,
  same acknowledged utime residual as the annotations stamp era).
  A stamped frame verified while NO key file exists (deleted or
  rotated key) also lands here, with a rotation warning — the
  verify side never creates a key (see :func:`_load_verify_key`).
* ``relocated`` — token valid under this install's key but the
  MAC-covered slot names a DIFFERENT directory (frame copied or
  moved from another run/project): demoted to the legacy tier with
  a distinct warning, never refused. A valid MAC proves the frame
  is this install's own unedited history; operator ``mv`` /
  ``/project adopt`` / restore flows dominate this shape, and
  refusal would grant nothing — stripping the token lands in the
  accepted legacy tier anyway. Same posture as the journal MAC's
  verified-but-attributed-elsewhere rows
  (``core.coverage.journal_mac``): demote the authority the binding
  earned, never drop the data.

Key
    ``$XDG_DATA_HOME/raptor/checklist-frame-mac.key`` (default
    ``~/.local/share/raptor/checklist-frame-mac.key``). Deliberately its
    OWN per-purpose key file, never the journal's: per-purpose keys
    keep reset/rotation semantics scoped — deleting this key demotes
    every stamped checklist frame to the unstamped tier and new
    writes re-key lazily, without touching the journal's trust
    surface (and vice versa). Kept OUTSIDE every LLM-writable and
    sandbox-readable tree, like every other MAC key.
