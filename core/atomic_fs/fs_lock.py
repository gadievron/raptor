"""Shared cross-process lock for load → merge → write artifact windows.

THE flock idiom RAPTOR's durable JSON stores use, hoisted so new
writers stop re-implementing it (the spec store, the coverage store,
and the study promotion each carry a local copy; new call sites route
here). Contract, matching those siblings:

- lock a sibling ``<artifact>.lock`` file, never the artifact itself —
  the artifact is atomically replaced on save, and flocking a replaced
  inode splits lockers;
- hold the lock across the WHOLE load → merge → write cycle;
- ``O_NOFOLLOW``: the lock file may live in a directory broader write
  grants reach — a planted symlink must not steer the flock to an
  attacker-chosen path. A refused open degrades to the unlocked path
  with a loud warning rather than failing the (best-effort) writer;
- ``O_NONBLOCK`` plus the post-open ``fstat`` regularity refusal: a
  planted reader-less FIFO at the lock path would otherwise block the
  writer forever on the bare ``O_WRONLY`` open, and a FIFO that has a
  reader would flock a non-regular inode. Both degrade to the same
  loud unlocked path (same discipline as
  ``core.run.metadata``'s metadata lock);
- foreign-uid refusal: a PRE-EXISTING lock file owned by another uid
  is never adopted. Any process that can create the predictable
  ``.lock`` sibling (a sandboxed child with a write grant over the
  artifact dir) could otherwise pre-create it, hold ``LOCK_EX``, and
  stall every cooperating writer indefinitely — the open succeeds, so
  the tamper-degrade arm never fired. A foreign owner degrades to the
  same loud unlocked path as a planted symlink or FIFO;
- bounded acquisition: the flock is taken ``LOCK_NB``-first; on
  contention the waiter says so ONCE (naming the subject and lock
  path), then polls up to a generous deadline. A wedged or hostile
  holder can no longer stall a writer silently and unboundedly — on
  expiry the writer degrades to the loud unlocked path (the same
  best-effort disposition every other lock-unavailable shape takes);
- degrade to a no-op without ``fcntl`` (non-POSIX);
- callers with ``required=True`` refuse every unlocked fallback above,
  including missing ``fcntl`` and bounded-acquisition expiry;
- the lock file is deliberately never unlinked — unlink-after-unlock
  races split lockers across two inodes. Its only content is the last
  acquirer's pid stamp (advisory, possibly stale — see
  :func:`stamp_lock_holder`).

Client-locality caveat (WSL drvfs/9p, no behaviour change): on a
Windows-interop mount, ``flock`` is implemented by the 9p client —
it serialises processes within one distro (one client) exactly as on
a local filesystem, but grants no exclusion against Windows-side
writers or other WSL distros mounting the same drive. Artifacts on
such mounts keep same-distro correctness and silently lose the
cross-context guarantee; placement guidance lives in docs/wsl.md.
