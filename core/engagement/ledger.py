"""Engagement artifact ledger — mechanical inventory of a target set.

One recursive enumeration of an operator-given install directory into
ARTIFACT ROWS: executables and shared objects (ELF facts via
:func:`core.binary.elf.extract_elf_facts`), kernel modules (the
``elf-kmod`` target-kind vocabulary from
``packages.fuzzing.target_detector``), archives (expanded through the
EXISTING hardened extractor :func:`core.archive.extract.extract_to_dir`
— children enter as rows with provenance links), data corpora
(family-clustered on the ``corpus_profile`` name-template vocabulary),
eBPF blobs (an ``EM_BPF`` classification row ONLY — analysis is a
later capability), and unreadable oddities (declared-degraded
``unknown`` rows). The ledger is CLOSED over the operator-given
directory: nothing outside ``target_root`` is ever enumerated.

Doctrine (pinned by ``.github/tests/test_engagement_ledger_doctrine.py``):

- **No LLM anywhere near classification.** Every row fact is a
  deterministic byte-level extraction, and every exposure feature
  names its mechanical extractor in an ``extractor`` field. This
  module must never import an LLM/dispatch seam.
- **Second-life provenance (M1).** Every row carries
  ``derived_from_target`` naming exactly which of its fields hold
  target-derived bytes; any render path escapes those fields per the
  ``core.security.log_sanitisation`` contract; store writes go through
  ``save_json`` (atomic) under :func:`core.atomic_fs.fs_lock.artifact_lock`.
  Nothing target-derived is ever a raw key in an operator-facing
  surface (family keys are fixed-vocabulary by construction; artifact
  ids are hex digests / identity anchors).
- **Identity collision detection (M2).** A build-id (or any producer-
  authored identity) is attacker-forgeable. Collisions are grouped by
  ``(kind, anchor)`` — the artifact-id key itself, so two DIFFERENT
  forged values sharing a 16-hex anchor prefix cannot alias to one
  artifact id / checklist slot — and ``sha256`` identities are
  included (a 64-bit anchor birthday is grindable). Every member of a
  colliding group with differing content demotes to content-hash
  identity WIDENED to the full digest (alias-proof by construction)
  and is flagged ``elevated_interest``; a member whose content hash
  could not be read is stripped of the colliding identity and re-keyed
  from its path (``unverified-<hex>``) — never left wearing a forged
  identity. All of it is recorded in the document's ``collisions``
  list. The same content-proof gates status write-back inheritance:
  a rebuild carries a row's previous engagement status only when the
  previous row's ``identity.sha256`` matches the current bytes — a
  replaced artifact wearing a persisted identity never inherits
  ``verdicted``.
- **Bounded expansion (S14).** Per-archive child caps + a recursion
  depth cap; an over-cap archive keeps its extracted children, gains
  one ``archive-remainder`` row for the unexpanded tail, and the
  document records an explicit "archive truncated at N of M" residual
  naming WHICH cap fired — never a silent partial. Members the
  hardened extractor drops (traversal-named, oversized, encrypted,
  unwritable) are counted per reason into an
  ``archive_members_dropped`` residual; hostile-name drops flag the
  archive row ``elevated_interest``.

Storage, all under the run/project OUTPUT directory (never the target):

- ``ledger.json`` — the document (schema below), atomically replaced
  under its sibling flock on every write.
- ``checklists/<artifact-id>.json`` — per-artifact coverage-
  denominator slots. This is the seam that retires the single
  project-checklist-slot race: each artifact's checklist (in the
  :mod:`core.inventory.binary_builder` schema, ``binary:<stem>`` file
  keys unchanged) gets its own slot keyed by the artifact's content
  identity, so concurrent audits of sibling binaries can no longer
  cross-inherit one shared slot. This module lands the WRITER and a
  reader API; migrating audit prep onto the reader is the composition
  series' job.
- ``ledger-extract/<artifact-id>/`` — bounded archive extraction
  trees (hardened extractor output only: regular files, no symlinks).

Document shape (``schema_version`` 1)::

    {
      "schema_version": 1, "generated_at": iso, "target_root": str,
      "caps": {...effective caps...},
      "counts": {"rows": n, "by_class": {...}},
      "rows": [ {row}, ... ],
      "reverse_needed": [ {"name","providers","consumers"}, ... ],
      "collisions": [ {"identity_kind","anchor","artifact_ids"}, ... ],
      "residuals": [ {"kind","message",...}, ... ],
    }

Row shape::

    {
      "artifact_id": "<identity_kind>-<anchor>" | "corpus-family-<hex>"
                     | "unverified-<hex>" (collision, hash unreadable),
      "class": target-kind vocab | "elf-ebpf" | "archive" |
               "archive-remainder" | "corpus-family" | "unknown",
      "format_tier": see FORMAT_TIER_BY_CLASS,
      "path": relative path (target-derived),
      "size_bytes": int,
      "identity": {"kind","value","anchor","sha256"} | None,
      "links": {"needed": [...], "soname": str|None} (ELF only),
      "exposure": [ {"feature","value","extractor"}, ... ],
      "family": {...} (corpus-family / archive-remainder only),
      "provenance": {"origin": "target_walk"|"archive_member", ...},
      "archive_format": str, "expanded": bool (archive rows only),
      "elevated_interest": bool, "elevated_interest_reason": str,
      "status": {"state","updated_at",...} (stage write-back slot),
      "caps_hit": [...], "derived_from_target": [field names],
    }

``reverse_needed`` entries carry ``derived_from_target: ["name"]`` —
the linked ``name`` is raw DT_NEEDED/soname bytes and must be escaped
at render exactly like row fields.

Policy slots (the depth-policy governor's durable state — the ledger
owns the SCHEMA, the governor owns the SEMANTICS):

- per-row ``policy`` — tier assignment record (tier / bucket / basis
  / signals / promotion provenance), written through
  :func:`set_artifact_policy`.
- per-row ``reservation`` — the budget governor's per-segment
  pessimistic charge (reserved / reconciled state, consecutive-death
  counter), written through the same seam.
- document-level ``policy`` — engagement-scoped policy state
  (envelope, feasibility verdict, park record, escalations), merged
  through :func:`update_engagement_policy`.
- document-level ``policy_amendments`` — the append-only degradation
  audit trail (S15), via :func:`append_policy_amendment`. A resume
  reads the AMENDED slots, never a recomputed launch policy.

Every policy write validates against a closed key set and token
charsets — policy state is steering-grade, so a value that is not
provably a minted id / fixed-vocabulary token / bounded number is
refused at the write, never stored. Rebuilds carry row policy slots
under the same content-hash proof as status (a replaced artifact
never keeps its tier or its reservation) and carry the document-level
policy block wholesale (engagement state, not artifact state).
