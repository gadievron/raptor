"""Annotation write lock: bounded waiting, cross-uid adoption kept.

The annotation lock is the documented two-operator rendezvous — a
lock file created by ANOTHER uid is legitimately taken (0o666 mode,
read-only open), so there is deliberately no foreign-uid refusal
here. The protection against a wedged or hostile holder is the
bounded announce-once wait: expiry raises AnnotationFileError instead
of stalling the writer silently and forever.
