"""Raising-flavor gated text read — the strict sibling of
:mod:`core.source.contained`.

The capped readers in :mod:`core.source.contained` are None-flavor:
every refusal (unreadable, non-regular, over-cap) collapses into one
"no text" answer, which suits best-effort analysis reads. Loaders
with a REQUIRED file — config, budget-gated JSON, spec documents —
need the opposite: each refusal class surfaces as a distinct
exception so the caller can report it (and only it) precisely.
:func:`read_bytes_gated` is the single body for that flavor
(:func:`read_text_gated` is its decode wrapper); it grew up as
``core.json.utils._read_text_gated`` backing ``load_json`` and is
promoted here so non-JSON strict readers consume the same discipline
instead of re-growing their own fstat/budget idiom
(``core.json.utils`` imports THIS implementation — one body, both
flavors' doctrine in one module family). The bytes flavor serves
consume-by-copy callers that must hash/archive the exact bytes they
parsed without a second read.

Raising vs None-flavor is the only axis that kept the two apart;
the gates are identical in kind:

- Regular files only, checked on the OPENED fd (a FIFO stats as 0
  bytes and then blocks a plain reader forever; ``O_NONBLOCK`` makes
  even the open of a reader-less FIFO return instead of hanging).
- ``max_bytes`` checked on the fstat size AND re-checked after a
  capped read, so a file that grows between fstat and read is
  refused instead of buffered unbounded (the GROW gate).
- ``follow_symlinks=False`` adds ``O_NOFOLLOW`` for callers whose
  path must not read through a final-component link. The default
  FOLLOWS symlinks by design — config loaders legitimately read
  through links; symlink-to-FIFO is still refused with the FIFO.
