    items from multi-line call continuations, the review loop reviewed

    name unvalidated. ``(file, function)`` is an identity key in the
    report join, cross-run dedup and project claim matching, so the
    misattribution corrupts joins — not just presentation.

    Dispositions:

    - ``"validated"`` — the claimed name is a checklist item for the
      file and nothing contradicts it; use as-is.
    - ``"corrected"`` — the checklist line ranges (preferred) or the
      source fallback identify a different enclosing function; the

    - ``"unverified"`` — the file is itemised but neither the claim
      nor the line resolves; keep the claim, disclose.
    - ``"no_basis"`` — no checklist / no entry for the file; nothing
      to validate against, pass through silently.

    non-int junk fished out of a finding dict coerces to "no usable
