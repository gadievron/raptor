"""CodeQL database provisioning for standalone /audit runs.

Standalone ``/audit`` historically took ``--codeql-db`` verbatim and
did nothing else — no discovery, no building — so runs without the
flag carried ``codeql_db_path: null`` and the CodeQL channel skipped
every hypothesis, silently. This module closes that gap in priority
order:

1. **Discover** databases the shared content-addressed cache already
   holds for this exact tree (``DatabaseManager.get_cached_database``
   keys on git commit + dirty-tree digest, so staleness is handled by
   construction; ``/codeql`` and ``/agentic`` populate the same
   cache).
2. **Build** missing databases in a background thread overlapping the
   audit's prep stages — but only for languages whose extraction runs
   no target build commands (extractor-only languages, and the
   buildless ``--build-mode=none`` compiled languages the CLI
   supports). Languages whose extraction would execute repo build
   logic (CodeQL autobuild) build only under the operator's ``build``
   trust marker / traced-build consent.
3. **Degrade loudly** otherwise: every language left without a
   database is recorded with the flag or marker that would provide
   one, written to ``codeql-provision.json`` and surfaced in the
   report — the channel must never again skip without saying so.

An explicit ``--codeql-db`` suppresses provisioning entirely (the
operator's declaration wins), and the ``codeql_enabled`` tuning
kill-switch is honoured.
