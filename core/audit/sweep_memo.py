"""Per-run memo for deterministic tool-chain sweep steps.

``_run_tool_chain`` re-dispatches the same (rule, file, function,
scope) sweep many times per run: the same hypothesis recurs across
review passes, critique re-checks, suspicious-promotion sweeps and
reused verdicts, and each dispatch re-spawns a semgrep / spatch /
codeql / compiler / SMT-child subprocess to recompute an identical
answer.  The memo caches the step's *result object* keyed on the
step's semantic inputs so only the subprocess is skipped — every
consuming site still performs its own bookkeeping (tier counters,
receipts, journal rows) on the returned result exactly as for a
fresh run.

Scope and soundness contract:

* Only deterministic, side-effect-free step classes are eligible
  (:data:`MEMOIZABLE_STEP_TYPES` — the semgrep / coccinelle / codeql /
  smt / compiler sweeps).  Steps whose results depend on mutable run
  state (dynamic/frida observation, dark-verify witness execution,
  Joern server sessions, channels that read SharedState or fold
  earlier chain receipts into their corroboration) are never
  memoized.
* Keys are built from CONTENT hashes of the steering inputs (rule /
  query text, target file bytes, source excerpt) plus the scoping
  values that select what the tool looks at (function name, line
  range, hypothesis binding).  Paths and mtimes alone never key an
  entry.  Any input that cannot be hashed makes the whole key ``None``
  and the step runs unmemoized.  The coccinelle leg memoizes at FILE
  scope — spatch always scans the whole file, so its key carries no
  function/line dimension and one entry serves every function in the
  file (scoping happens after retrieval); a vocab-rendered rule keys
  on the RENDERED rule bytes, so a vocabulary change is a miss.
* The memo lives exactly one run (it is owned by the run's
  ``OrchestratorConfig``) and the audited target tree is read-only for
  that lifetime, which is what bounds inputs the key cannot
  practically hash in full (a TU's ``#include`` closure, a CodeQL
  database's row data — the database is additionally pinned by its
  metadata file's content hash).
* ``error`` outcomes are never stored: a transient failure (tool
  timeout, sandbox refusal) pinned for the run would suppress every
  later retry of that step.  Results whose negative-control leg
  errored (``details["negative_control_error"]``) are never stored
  either: they are uncapped only because a broken control must not
  fabricate inconclusive outcomes, and pinning one would replay the
  uncapped verdict forever without re-running the control.
* Stored and returned values are deep copies, so no two consumers
  ever share a mutable result object with each other or with the
  cache.
