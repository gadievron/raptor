"""Generation-aware provenance on the gap fold — the incident class.

A follow-on audit run folding a prior run's journal demoted 1,490
honest prior rows to the unstamped tier when a version-skewed reader's
dataclass round-trip dropped a MAC-covered field (the slim-clean
``body_offload`` pointer) before the token recompute: exact-hash fold
credit survived, but every $0 verdict reuse was forfeited and the run
re-paid for reviews. These tests reconstruct that shape (structure
only — synthetic rows) and pin the repair: a genuine row whose
projection is lossy verifies via the raw-form ladder rung and RETAINS
verdict-reuse authority, forged rows still demote on every generation,
and the fold log buckets every demotion by reason.
