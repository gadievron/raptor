"""Journal body must agree with the stored verdict.

Observed field failure: a journal record carried verdict=suspicious
while its body ended "Verdict: clean" — the counter-hypothesis
escalation flipped the status after the prose was generated and never
annotated the text, leaving the operator to guess which to trust.
Every in-review status flip (counter escalation, all-refuted
demotion) now stamps a gate marker at
the top of the body. Also covers the loud-once fix-history skip on
non-git targets. Hermetic — LLM stubbed.
