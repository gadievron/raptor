"""Transport/product partition for the live adjudication legs.

The live legs in this directory run real engines (semgrep, the
compiler analyzers, interpreters) and adjudicate ground truth from
their results. Under battery load the RUNTIME sometimes fails to
carry an engine at all — the child cannot be spawned (fork OSError),
hits the deadline, or is signal-killed by the resource ceiling — and
the sweep honestly reports an error result. That error is a statement
about the test environment, not about the classification logic under
test, so the affected leg must SKIP with the transport's reason, in
both directions and observed under battery load at identical trees.

Every error shape that describes what the engine DID — a wrong
verdict, an unparseable rule, a positive exit code, a parse failure
on the fixture — stays a hard failure. The partition below is keyed
on the FULL result identity (tool + outcome + rule_id keying + the
exact minted reason, anchored), exactly the idiom of
``test_sanwit_live._skip_if_runtime_degraded``: a product regression
that mints ``error`` for a reason the transport never produces still
fails the assertions that follow.

Guard-shape notes (all minted strings verified against the product
code that mints them; the anti-drift pins live in
``test_live_transport_guards.py``):

* semgrep — ``packages.semgrep.runner.run_rule`` mints the transport
  errors with ``returncode=-1``; ``core.audit.sweep.run_semgrep_sweep``
  surfaces them with ``rule_id=rule_config`` (truthy). The sweep's own
  ``rule_id=None`` arms are product/config territory (missing file,
  the closing broad except) EXCEPT the exact pre-spawn
  ``"semgrep not installed"`` arm.
* anchoring — ``\\Z``, not ``$`` (``$`` also matches before a trailing
  newline, widening the deadline arm to suffixed spellings).
* ``SandboxSetupError`` derives from ``BaseException`` and escapes the
  sweep's ``except Exception``; the guarded runners convert it to a
  skip (same treatment as test_dynamic_sweep_forgery).
