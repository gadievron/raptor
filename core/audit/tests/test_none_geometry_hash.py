"""None-geometry source hashing covers the fallback read window.

A checklist item with no measured ``line_end`` is reviewed over the
``SOURCE_SPAN_FALLBACK_LINES`` read window
(``core.audit.context._read_source``), but its staleness hash used to
cover only the single header line — so body edits below the header
never flipped the hash and changed code was silently reused as
reviewed. The hash now covers the SAME window the prompt showed
(``core.audit.context.fallback_span_end``), on the stamp side
(``core.audit.record._compute_hash``) and on every verify side (the
journal fold's span candidates, the resume drift gate, the
coverage-record import gate) — a verify side left on the single line
would read every window-stamped row as permanent drift and re-buy the
same review on every fold.

Measured-``line_end`` spans are byte-identical to the pre-fix hashes
(pinned literals below): only None geometry changes, so existing
measured-span stamps keep verifying. Existing None-geometry stamps
mismatch once and re-review once — the intended fail-closed
migration.
