"""A receipt the run earned must reach the outcome as a tool stamp.

The pre-loop SMT screen runs real solver checks before the review loop
and, on a confirming hit, injects the receipt into the review prompt as
context. The model then restates the tool in its ``evidence_tool``
answer, and sanitisation (correctly) namespaces that restatement to
``llm-claimed:*`` — LLM-supplied values never pass as tool evidence.
But nothing wrote the run's OWN receipt back onto the reviewed outcome,
so the row travelled with ``llm-claimed:`` provenance: the
verification-evidence exemptions downstream (conservative ensemble
merge, quality suppression) never fired for a function a solver had
actually confirmed.

The discriminating direction stays intact: a model that merely NAMES a
tool, without a confirming receipt from the run's own records, must
keep the ``llm-claimed:`` prefix and earn no exemption.
