"""Build-once cache for checklist-CLI corpora shared across audit tests.

Many audit tests need a real ``checklist.json`` built by the libexec
CLI over a tiny synthetic corpus. The build is deterministic for a
given corpus content (canonical-hash verified: two builds of the same
corpus at different roots produce identical inventories once the
``generated_at`` / ``target_path`` / ``_stat`` / frame-token fields
are stripped), so re-running the CLI in a fresh interpreter for every
test or module that starts from the same corpus only re-pays the CLI
startup and inventory-walk cost.

The session-scoped ``checklist_builds`` fixture (conftest.py) exposes
:class:`ChecklistBuildCache`: each DISTINCT corpus builds once per
pytest process (per xdist worker) and is shared from then on. Corpora
that differ in any byte hash to different keys and never share.

Sharing discipline:

* The shared target tree and built run dir are made read-only on
  disk after the build. A consumer that mutates either fails loudly
  (``PermissionError``) instead of silently poisoning every other
  consumer of the same corpus. Tests that need to mutate the corpus
  (e.g. adding a source file before building) keep their own private
  build.
* Consumers get a copy-on-write run dir via
  :meth:`SharedChecklistBuild.make_run_dir` — a private writable copy
  of the built artifacts for the audit stages to write into. The
  checklist frame is HMAC-stamped and slot-bound
  (``core.inventory.checklist_frame_mac``), so the copy is re-stamped
  for its new slot under the CURRENT test's key: consumers see
  exactly the verified-tier frame a fresh in-test build would earn
  (the per-test ``XDG_DATA_HOME`` isolation rotates the key between
  tests, so the shared build's original stamp could never verify).
* The shared TARGET path is handed out as-is: the checklist embeds
  the absolute target path it was built over, so consumers must pass
  ``SharedChecklistBuild.target`` (never a copy) as the target.
