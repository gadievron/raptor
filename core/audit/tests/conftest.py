Journal appends stamp rows with an HMAC key under

the witness/iris/scorecard integrity layers keep sibling keys in the

    their full grace. Restore the disposition (production
    uninstall first, belt-and-braces direct restore second) around

    The snapshot itself can be the grace handler: a HIGHER-scoped
