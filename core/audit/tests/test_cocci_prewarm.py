"""Coccinelle lookahead prewarm: caller-side memo pinning.

Covers the rent-to-buy trigger, chunk construction (parent-directory
cwd parity), verdict pinning parity with run_coccinelle_file_sweep's
result shape and memo key, the pin-nothing stance on failed batches,
per-run state isolation, the advisory (never-raise) contract, and the
two-direction pins on the module's caps.
