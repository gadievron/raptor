"""Witness-backlog ``reimport`` — additive re-listing of dark rows.

The backlog is the drain's only row source: a listing the producer
truncated on disk leaves the unlisted identities undrainable, and the
graded findings export is where they still live. ``reimport`` merges
them back — additively by contract: existing site dicts are never
modified (``drain_attempts`` preserved), the ``drained`` ledger is
never touched, no row is ever removed, already-listed identities are
never listed twice, and witnessed rows never resurrect (refusing
loudly when their identities are unrecoverable). Synthetic fixtures
throughout — no LLM calls anywhere in this lane.
