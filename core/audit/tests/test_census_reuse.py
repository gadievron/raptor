"""Battery census reuse: the consistency prepass already builds the
census; the mechanical battery rebuilding it paid the per-site
scope-walk cost twice per run. Reuse is gated on coverage,
completeness, and cache provenance — see _reusable_prepass_census.

Two wiring pins guard the seam itself, not just the helper:

* the prep ORDER pin drives the real ``_compute_audit_prep`` and
  asserts the census is already stashed on config when the battery
  phase is invoked (the reuse is dead code if the battery runs
  first — the original review blocker);
* the kwargs-capture pin drives the real
  ``_run_mechanical_detectors`` and asserts the stashed census object
  reaches ``detect_callsite_deviations`` (and that a superset
  census's out-of-set deviations never enter the battery's records).
