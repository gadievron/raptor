"""Owner-runnable rotation remedy for oversized audit-log trails.

Pre-rotation installs appended ``.audit-log.jsonl`` unbounded; a
trail past the per-shard read budget degrades to a bounded
newest-tail read (see :func:`core.audit.record.load_audit_log_disclosed`).
:func:`rotate_audit_log` restores full readability by re-splitting
the trail's existing bytes VERBATIM into a contiguous shard set.
Each shard ends at most one line past the writer's roll threshold
(the roll check runs at line starts), so the per-shard read budget
holds whenever no single line exceeds the budget's margin over the
threshold — shards still over the budget are reported, not silently
accepted:

- Rows are never rewritten, reordered, or dropped — the
  concatenation of the shards after rotation is byte-identical to
  the concatenation before it (verified before the swap; on mismatch
  nothing is replaced). Per-row integrity stamps are bound to the
  run DIRECTORY, not the file name, so every previously-verifying
  row still verifies after the split.
- Splits happen only at line boundaries; a torn final line (crashed
  writer) stays torn at the end of the last shard, exactly as the
  tolerant reader already handles it.
- Originals are preserved as ``<name>.pre-rotate`` backups
  (first-free naming — an existing backup is never overwritten).
- Shard sources must be regular files: an ``lstat`` check over the
  set plus ``O_NOFOLLOW`` on every source open (the same read
  discipline ``core.json.load_jsonl`` applies to these paths)
  refuses a symlink or special file planted at a shard name, so the
  rewrite can never launder foreign file content into the trail.
- LIVE runs are refused via the journal-compaction gate
  (:func:`core.coverage.journal_compact.refuse_live_run`): a
  concurrent appender racing the swap could land rows on a pre-swap
  inode (the backup) and silently lose them. The gate fails closed
  on an unreadable run record and stays permissive when no record
  exists (foreign / legacy dirs).
- Two backstops behind the gate: byte accounting over the snapshot
  files is reconciled before anything is replaced, and the shard set
  is re-enumerated immediately before the swap — a shard that
  appeared (an appender rolling to the next number lands on a name
  pass 2 would otherwise rename over), vanished, or moved size
  refuses with nothing replaced. Ordinary swap failures restore the original trail; process death
  during the swap still requires the recovery described below.

Crash window: between moving the originals to their backups and
renaming the new shards into place, the trail lives only in the
backups. Re-running rotate after such a crash is a no-op on the
missing trail — recovery is renaming the ``.pre-rotate`` files back,
then re-running.
