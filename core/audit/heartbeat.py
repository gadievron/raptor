"""Best-effort progress heartbeat for long mechanical phases.

The mechanical phases (coccinelle sweeps, the census pre-passes, the
joern pre-sweep) can grind for hours without touching the run
directory, leaving operators nothing but ``/proc`` spelunking to tell
a live run from a wedged one. Instrumented loops call
:meth:`Heartbeat.beat` freely; the object throttles to at most one
write per :data:`HEARTBEAT_INTERVAL_S` and replaces
``<run_dir>/heartbeat.json`` atomically (tempfile + rename), so a
reader never sees a torn file and the hot loops never pay more than a
monotonic-clock read per call.

Strictly diagnostic: a write failure warns once per instance, the
instance disables itself, and the run is never affected. Not a
pipeline stage — phases that already loop just call ``beat`` from
inside the loop. Phases may overlap (the joern pre-sweep runs
concurrently with prep); each write is atomic and self-describing
(``phase`` names the writer), so the file always shows the most
recent activity from SOME live phase.

# needless writes on network/overlay filesystems). Not higher: the

# hundred bytes, not an unbounded log line.
