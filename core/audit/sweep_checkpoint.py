"""Durable cross-segment checkpoint for memoized coccinelle sweeps.

The per-run :class:`~core.audit.sweep_memo.SweepMemo` dies with its
process, so a drained-and-resumed run re-pays every (rule, file)
spatch invocation the previous segment already completed. This module
persists the memo's coccinelle entries under the RUN DIRECTORY as an
append-only JSONL trail (``sweep-checkpoint.jsonl``) so a resumed
segment serves them from disk instead of re-spawning spatch.

Soundness contract (inherits the memo's, plus durability rules):

* Keys are the memo keys — CONTENT digests of the steering inputs
  (rendered rule bytes, target file bytes) plus plain scoping scalars
  (relative path, defines rendering). A changed rule or changed file
  produces a different key, so the stale record is simply never hit
  and the sweep re-runs. Nothing here trusts paths or mtimes.
* Only tools in :data:`CHECKPOINTABLE_TOOLS` persist. The coccinelle
  file sweep is a pure function of (rule bytes, file bytes, defines);
  the other memoizable step types carry inputs whose identity is only
  pinned per-process (CodeQL database rows, SMT verb vocabularies) and
  stay memo-only.
* ``error`` outcomes and results whose negative-control leg errored
  are never persisted — the same refusals as ``SweepMemo.put``, for
  the same reasons, made durable they would be strictly worse.
* Fail-open direction is fixed: a corrupt, unreadable, oversize, or
  version-mismatched checkpoint WARNS ONCE and loads NOTHING — the
  run recomputes every sweep (correct, just slower). No failure mode
  may cause a sweep to be SKIPPED on bad data. A corrupt trail is
  additionally rotated aside (``.corrupt`` suffix) so the segment's
  fresh records start a clean file and the next resume is not poisoned
  by the same bytes. The load open is ``O_NOFOLLOW | O_NONBLOCK`` with
  a post-open regularity check, so a planted symlink or FIFO at the
  trail path is refused into the same rotation — never followed,
  never blocks the loader (which runs under the registry lock).
* Writes are concurrent-writer safe by construction: every record is
  one fully-formed line appended via the shared ``core.json.jsonl``
  byte writer (O_APPEND + single ``os.write`` — line-atomic for these record
  sizes, O_NOFOLLOW against planted symlinks). There is no
  read-modify-write of shared file state, so parallel workers — and a
  future cross-file worker pool on the primary pass — compose with
  this trail unchanged.
* Records are AUTHENTICATED. The trail lives in the run directory —
  target-writable during runs — and a replayed record steers tool
  verdicts: a forged ``refuted`` record suppresses a real
  confirmation, a forged ``confirmed`` record mints a tool receipt
  with spatch never having run. The content digests in the key
  authenticate WHAT was swept, not WHO recorded the result — they
  are computable from world-readable inputs. So every appended
  record carries an HMAC-SHA256 token (``integrity`` field) over the
  record's canonical JSON under a per-purpose 32-byte key
  (``$XDG_DATA_HOME/raptor/sweep-checkpoint-mac.key``, the shared
  ``core.security.mac_key`` discipline), domain-separated
  (``sweep-checkpoint-record``) and RUN-BOUND: the MAC message
  includes the run dir's resolved path, so a trail replanted from
  another run's directory fails verification — the same posture as
  the audit-log lane in ``core/coverage/journal_mac.py``. Load
  adopts ONLY verified records; tampered and unstamped records are
  skipped (recompute, never adopt) with one warning carrying
  verified/tampered/unstamped counts. There is no unstamped legacy
  tier: this file format has never existed without record tokens,
  so unstamped means forged-or-foreign, never "old" (no era fence
  needed). A missing or unusable key disables the checkpoint — warn
  once, recompute everything, never crash, never adopt an
  unverified record.
