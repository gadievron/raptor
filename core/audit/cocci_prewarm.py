"""Lookahead prewarm for the coccinelle sweep leg.

The orchestrator's coccinelle leg memoizes ONE file sweep per
(rendered-rule content, file content) — see ``run_coccinelle_file_sweep``
— which removes the per-function multiplier but leaves the per-file
floor: every file in the inventory still costs one fork+exec'd
sandboxed spatch, serially, as its first function comes up for audit
(~0.3-0.8 s each; >13 h per rule on a 63k-file tree).

This module is a strictly caller-side consumer of that memo. When the
leg dispatches a (rule, file) pair, ``maybe_prewarm`` is called BEFORE
the memoized step. Once a few distinct files have been dispatched
against the same rendered rule ("rent-to-buy": the rule has proven it
is being swept broadly, so warming ahead will be consumed), it batches
the upcoming inventory files — grouped by parent directory so the
spatch cwd matches single-file mode's include resolution — through
multi-file ``run_rule`` invocations on a bounded worker pool, splits
the combined result per file, and pins each file's sweep result into
the run's ``SweepMemo``. The serial dispatch that follows then hits.

Correctness stance:

* Pinned results are built to be indistinguishable from what
  ``run_coccinelle_file_sweep`` returns for the same inputs: same
  argv path spelling (``target_path / file_path``, so match dicts
  carry identical ``file`` fields), same cwd (the file's parent
  directory), same ``defines={}`` / ``allow_scripting=True`` /
  rule identity (``rule_id`` is always the SOURCE rule path, never a
  rendered tempfile), same confirmed-iff-matches classification.
* Only ``confirmed`` / ``refuted`` verdicts are pinned. A failed or
  timed-out batch pins NOTHING — those files fall back to the plain
  per-file path, which computes (and classifies) them itself. Files
  the substrate gate would skip are never batched, so their skip
  receipts also come from the real sweep.
* Memo keys are built with the same parts the leg uses
  (rule hash / file content hash / path / defines) via
  ``SweepMemo.make_key`` — a key the leg would not construct
  identically is impossible by shape, and any un-hashable input
  degrades to "don't pin".

Failure stance: everything here is advisory. ``maybe_prewarm``
swallows every exception (debug-logged) — the worst outcome of a
prewarm bug is the pre-existing serial behaviour.

#     memo can safely hold — the memo is a 1024-entry LRU shared with
#     the semgrep/SMT/CodeQL legs, so a burst must stay well inside
#     that window or it evicts entries before the serial cursor
#     consumes them (and evicts OTHER tools' hot entries). It also
#     stretches the synchronous burst latency paid by one dispatch.
#   * Lower and the burst cannot fill the batch worker pool
#     (derive_batch_workers caps at 16 lanes), so the parallel win
#     shrinks and bursts fire more often, each paying pool spin-up.
