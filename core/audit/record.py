"""Source-hash + audit-log helpers for the /audit review loop.

Post-migration surface: ``record_review`` and the ``coverage-audit.json``
writer path were removed as part of the annotation → journal migration
(see ``design/coverage-annotation-redesign-amendment-2026-07-28.md``).
The review journal is the sole authority for LLM review state; the
coverage store imports LLM review existence from the journal, not from
this module.

What remains here:

- :func:`_compute_hash` — source-content hash for staleness detection.
  Called by :func:`core.audit.collector.append_journal_for_outcome`.
- :func:`load_audit_log` / :func:`append_audit_log` — the
  ``.audit-log.jsonl`` event log. Carries non-review events
  (context-load / tool-dispatch / batch-flush) PLUS per-review
  telemetry: Collector.submit still appends one
  ``action="orchestrator_review"`` record per review (status,
  hypothesis, evidence_tool, cost) which strategy_stats aggregates
  for cross-run strategy win rates. The review journal (from
  2026-07-28 onwards) remains the sole AUTHORITY for verdicts —
  these log records are telemetry, not review state.
- :func:`_resolve_annotations_dir` — project-level annotations dir
  resolution, used by consumers that write / read human annotations.

#: PER-SHARD read budgets for the audit event log (see
#: load_audit_log). Historically these were whole-log budgets and the
#: comment above them claimed "a legitimate log is a few MB on the
#: largest runs" — falsified in production: a multi-segment run's
#: trail crossed the 64 MiB budget on a mid-sized target, and
#: the loader's refuse-whole arm silently fed [] to every consumer
#: (resume suppression, fail-open deferral, telemetry) for the rest
#: of the run. The writer now rolls to numbered sibling shards below
#: this budget (see _AUDIT_LOG_SHARD_ROLL_BYTES) and the loader reads
#: the contiguous shard set, so the budget is a per-file hostile-input
#: bound again, not a ceiling on legitimate trail growth. Trade-off,
#: both directions: LOWER multiplies shard count (per-shard open/scan
#: overhead) for the same trail; HIGHER grows the single-allocation
#: worst case a planted file can force on every loader.
_AUDIT_LOG_MAX_BYTES = 64 * 1024 * 1024
#: Real rows are a few hundred bytes to a few KiB (review telemetry
#: with hypothesis text); 1 MiB keeps ~3 orders of magnitude of
#: headroom while bounding what one hostile line can make the reader
#: buffer.
_AUDIT_LOG_MAX_LINE_BYTES = 1024 * 1024

#: Retained-row COUNT bound per shard. The byte budget alone does not
#: bound reader memory: parsed-object overhead is per row, so a flood
#: of minimal rows under the byte budget could retain millions of
#: objects. Trade-off, both directions: too low and a legitimately
#: dense shard reads partial (disclosed, over-review direction); too
#: high and the tiny-row flood OOMs the reader. A production
#: multi-segment trail measured ~2 KiB/row — a full 64 MiB shard is
#: ~34k such rows, so 500k is >10x headroom over the densest
#: plausible legitimate shard.
_AUDIT_LOG_MAX_ROWS_PER_SHARD = 500_000

#: Roll threshold for the ACTIVE shard (same 3/4 ratio as the review
#: journal's shards). Trade-off, both directions: LOWER means more
#: shard files for the same trail; HIGHER pushes a full shard toward
#: the per-shard read budget, whose overflow arm degrades that shard
#: to a newest-tail read. 3/4 leaves a full margin for appends that
#: race the roll decision.
_AUDIT_LOG_SHARD_ROLL_BYTES = (_AUDIT_LOG_MAX_BYTES * 3) // 4

#: Shard-count bound. Trade-off, both directions: LOWER stops rolling
#: on a legitimate mega-run (its final shard then grows past the read
#: budget and degrades to a disclosed newest-tail read — bounded
#: remedy: ``raptor-audit audit-log rotate``); HIGHER scales a
#: hostile plant fan-out and the loader's worst-case aggregate work
#: linearly. 64 shards ≈ 3 GiB of trail — about double the largest
#: trail projected for the biggest targets (a production
#: multi-segment run measured ~1.4x ONE read budget on a target
#: roughly 1/16 that size).
