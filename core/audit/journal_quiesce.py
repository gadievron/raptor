"""Quiesce coordinator for the mid-audit journal checkpoint.

One object per orchestrator run, shared by every call site so the
trigger cadence, hysteresis, and cooldowns are a single state
machine (never two implementations):

* the review executor's quiesce points (``core.audit.executor`` —
  serial loop head, async loop head after a bounded inflight drain);
* the orchestrator's segment boundaries (post-review drain, post-
  loop passes);
* ``raptor-audit resume`` runs the checkpoint core directly at
  segment start (no executor exists yet, nothing to quiesce).

The transform itself lives in
``core.coverage.journal_checkpoint.checkpoint_journal`` — this class
adds what only the audit side knows: the study consumer's park /
resume protocol, the run's own worker-pid self-permit, the SIGTERM
drain signal, and the executor-facing cadence (evaluation interval,
drain bound, retry cooldown).

The whole point is the NO-RESTART property: the run pauses for
seconds of compaction instead of paying a drain/resume cycle
(Joern/CPG reload, prep-cache rebuild, dispatcher re-init — tens of
minutes). The checkpoint touches the journal shards, the sidecar,
their archives, the load cache (one cold reload), and its own state
record — nothing else (pinned by the no-restart spy suite).

#: How often the executor's dispatch-point polls re-evaluate the

#: LOWER stats the shard set on every dispatch of a hot serial loop
#: for a threshold that moves megabytes per minute at most; HIGHER
#: lets the journal overshoot the trigger by a whole interval of
#: appends — the 65% trigger's margin below the 75% roll threshold
#: is sized to absorb exactly that. 60s costs microseconds per
#: minute and bounds the overshoot to one interval of review output.
_QUIESCE_EVAL_INTERVAL_S = 60.0

#: Bound on the executor's wait for inflight → 0 once the trigger
#: fires — sized to the longest single review (a full-context review
#: with tool chains runs minutes; the review-side timeouts cap it
#: well under this). Trade-off, both directions: LOWER abandons
#: quiesce attempts whenever one slow-but-live review is in flight
#: (the checkpoint then only ever runs at boundaries — the mid-
#: segment wall this exists to remove); HIGHER holds dispatch
#: stopped behind a wedged review for that much longer before giving
#: up (workers idle, spend paused — bounded, but pure lost
#: throughput). 900s outlasts every sanctioned review timeout while
#: capping a wedge's cost to one review-length pause.
_QUIESCE_DRAIN_BOUND_S = 900.0

#: Cooldown after a failed attempt (drain timeout, park timeout,
#: checkpoint abort): do not re-attempt for this long. Trade-off,
#: both directions: LOWER re-runs the drain dance straight into the
#: same slow review (stop-start dispatch thrash); HIGHER leaves the
#: journal growing past an already-fired trigger with the roll
#: threshold approaching. 300s ≈ a few reviews' worth of settling.
_QUIESCE_RETRY_COOLDOWN_S = 300.0

#: Minimum spacing between repeated "journal legitimately large"
#: advisory lines from the quiesce evaluation path (boundaries always
#: emit theirs). Trade-off, both directions: LOWER turns a standing
#: hysteresis state into a log flood at the evaluation cadence;
#: HIGHER hides from a live tail that the journal is pinned over
#: threshold. One line per half hour keeps it visible, not noisy.
