"""HMAC provenance for review-journal rows.

Review-journal entries are the durable record the gap fold trusts: a
row whose ``verdict`` is conclusive and whose ``source_hash`` matches
the current source SUPPRESSES future review of that function (and,
when eligible, is imported as a $0 reused verdict). The journal lives
in run/project directories that are target-writable during runs and
restorable verbatim by ``/project import`` — and rows were plain
unauthenticated JSON, so a forged ``clean`` row silenced review of a
function forever.

Writers stamp each row at append time with an HMAC-SHA256 token over
the row's canonical JSON (token key excluded); the fold verifies
before granting a row verdict-reuse authority, and rows whose token
is present but invalid are skipped entirely (tampered). Rows with NO
token (pre-MAC legacy, or forged-unstamped) keep fold-credit only
behind the exact full-length source-hash gate and are never eligible
for $0 verdict reuse — the tolerant-reader compromise that avoids a
re-review storm on upgrade while denying unauthenticated rows every
authority tier above "the source hash checks out". Same trust story
and key-handling discipline as ``core/witness/provenance.py`` /
``core/llm/scorecard/integrity.py``.

Key
    ``$XDG_DATA_HOME/raptor/journal-mac.key`` (default
    ``~/.local/share/raptor/journal-mac.key``). Deliberately its OWN
    key file — per-purpose keys keep reset/rotation semantics scoped.
    No rotation: deleting the key demotes every stamped row to the
    unstamped tier (fold-credit behind the hash gate, no reuse) and
    new appends re-key lazily.

The ``.audit-log.jsonl`` event log in the same directory carries one
row class with the same authority (resume review-suppression via
``get_reviewed_set``) and gets the same treatment through its own
domain prefix (:func:`mint_audit_log_row` /
:func:`verify_audit_log_row`): writers stamp every appended event,
and the resume reader lets a row suppress ONLY when its token
verifies — everything else in the log stays telemetry-tier and
tolerant. UNLIKE journal rows, audit-log tokens ARE run-bound: the
MAC covers the run dir's resolved-path identity
(:func:`audit_log_run_binding`), supplied implicitly by whichever
directory the verifier reads — a row copied verbatim from a sibling
run's log fails verification, because the audit-log lane has no
source-hash gate or fold to bound a replay the way the journal does
(a replayed clean row is NOT genuine history for another run's
resume set). Moving a run dir demotes its rows to unstamped —
re-review, the safe direction, same posture as cross-install.

No run binding for JOURNAL rows: they deliberately travel across
runs — the project index aggregates them and cross-run verdict reuse
is the feature. A replayed validly-stamped row is genuine history
for the exact source hash it names; staleness is bounded by the
fold's hash compare, not the MAC, and the reuse import demotes the
row's tool receipts to prior-claim context
(``journal:recall:<origin>``) rather than confirming evidence. The
one journal consumer that DOES grant a row run-attributed receipt
authority — the journal-derived graded export — therefore adds a
run-scope check on top of the MAC: ``run_id`` is covered by the
token, so a verified row's run attribution is authentic, and
receipts are honoured only when it names the consuming run
(legacy rows without attribution grandfather with a visible
marker). A byte-copied row still verifies as genuine INSTALL
history; it no longer passes as another run's own record.

Forward compatibility: verification round-trips the row through this
reader's dataclass, so a row written by a NEWER schema (additive
fields this reader doesn't know) — or stamped by another install's
key — reads as token-present-but-unverifiable. That is NOT treated
as a distinct security tier: whoever can edit a row can simply strip
its token and land in the unstamped tier anyway, so consumers demote
unverifiable rows to the same unstamped tier (exact-hash-gated fold
credit, never verdict reuse) instead of dropping them below it.

Canonicalisation generations. A token attests the row's canonical
byte form, and that form is a shipped artifact: the serializer pin
(``dumps_canonical``), the MAC message derivation, and the row-field
vocabulary the writer's schema could emit. Any of those changing
between mint and verify demotes every honest prior row at once — a
follow-on run then re-buys reviews that were already paid for (an
exhaustive audit run of a large C codebase lost 1,490 prior verdicts
to one such fold). Verification is therefore GENERATION-AWARE:

* every token carries its mint generation — generation 1 is the bare
  64-hex form every writer has ever emitted (absence of a prefix IS
  the gen-1 tag; ``g1:`` is deliberately not an accepted alias), and
  future generations mint ``g<N>:<hex>`` with the generation bound
  into the MAC message (:func:`_mac_message`), so a token can never
  be claimed across generations;
* a row verifies under the generation it was minted with, drawn from
  the CLOSED ladder ``_KNOWN_GENERATIONS`` — each rung an exact byte
  form this repo actually shipped, never a normalizing/fuzzy match.
  An unknown or malformed generation tag fails outright. The strict
  grammar is itself a deliberate fail-closed CHANGE: the
  pre-generation verifier normalised tokens with ``.strip().lower()``,
  so uppercase or whitespace-padded tokens DID verify before. No
  shipped writer ever emitted such a token — every mint is the bare
  lowercase ``hexdigest()`` — so no honest row is affected;
* verification success under a legacy generation grants the SAME
  authority as the current one (the whole point: schema churn must
  not forfeit verdicts), and the index merge re-stamps such rows at
  the current generation so the ladder's live population shrinks;
* a row that verifies under NO known generation demotes exactly as
  before (unstamped tier).

Within generation 1, TWO shipped byte forms exist and both are
enumerated: the reader-projection form (the dataclass round-trip
this module always verified — the only form available for entries
reconstructed programmatically) and the persisted-raw form (the
exact bytes every writer actually minted over, stashed by the
journal loader as :data:`RAW_FORM_ATTR`). The raw form is what keeps
a row verifiable when the live dataclass drifts — the incident
class: a version-skewed reader's round-trip drops a stamped field it
does not know, and projection-only verification then reads honest
rows as tampered. The raw form is bounded by the generation's FIELD
VOCABULARY (:data:`_GENERATION_VOCABULARY`): a row whose extra keys
fall outside the enumerated shipped vocabulary never verifies via
the raw form, preserving the covered-additive-field invariant — a
future writer's authority-bearing field must gate this reader's
authority grant, not slide past it (see
``test_covered_additive_field_demotes_to_tampered``).

    Coverage records are the OTHER durable review-suppression lane
    beside the journal: a ``functions_analysed`` row under a
    review-grade tool label removes the named function from the gap
    fold's review queue, and the records live in the same
    target-writable run/project directories — a dropped
    ``coverage-llm.json`` naming a function silenced its review with
    no stamp, no verdict and no source evidence. Same canonical form
    and key as the journal, own domain.

    Per-ROW, not per-record, deliberately: the mark/unmark CLI and
    the run-completion snapshot read-modify-write whole records, so a
    record-level token would re-stamp — launder — any planted row
    that was sitting in the file when a legitimate writer next saved
    it. Rows are stamped once at CREATION (record builders, the mark
    CLI append) and copied verbatim by every RMW writer, so a planted
    row stays unstamped no matter how many legitimate saves follow.

    TOOL-BOUND: the record's ``tool`` label is part of the domain,
    because the label is what grades a row's authority — a row
    legitimately minted for a scanned-tier record (``understand``
    map-grade marks: examination evidence, never review credit) must
    not verify when replayed into a review-grade ``coverage-llm.json``.
    Not run-bound, same rationale as journal rows: records aggregate
    across runs by design and a replayed stamped row is genuine
    install history for the row it names.

    ``None`` = persist unstamped — the fold then grants credit only
    behind the exact full-length source-hash gate
    (``core.audit.gaps._build_covered_set``), the journal's
    tolerant-reader compromise. That gate is source-CURRENCY, not
    authentication: the hash is unkeyed and computable from readable
    source, so a hash-carrying plant passes it — the gate exists to
    keep legacy rows credited while refusing hashless plants and
    stale credit. Authorship assurance is this token, nothing
    weaker."""
