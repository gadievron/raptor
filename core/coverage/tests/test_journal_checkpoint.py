"""Mid-audit journal checkpoint — trigger, hysteresis, tiers, guard,
bounded abort, drain interplay, consumer invalidation.

Charter safety requirements pinned here (kill matrix in
``test_journal_checkpoint_killmatrix.py``; executor quiesce plumbing
in ``core/audit/tests/test_journal_quiesce.py``):

1. enforced precondition guard — ``CheckpointBusy`` on inflight
   review work, a busy probe, or a non-empty collector; raised even
   for an under-threshold journal (the guard is unconditional);
2. lock order — the collector is flushed and proven empty strictly
   BEFORE the compactor's first journal ``flock`` (instrumented);
3. foreign appenders blocked across the checkpoint's rename land
   their row in the LIVE journal (integration with the appender's
   post-flock inode re-validation);
5. drain interplay — an abort signal observed before the swap leaves
   the journal byte-identical; one observed after the swap lets the
   completed swap stand (both orderings);
6. consumer invalidation — exactly ONE cold reload of the load cache
   per checkpoint, and a re-checkpoint of an already-slimmed journal
   preserves stub hydration;
7. bounded — exceeding the wall bound aborts cleanly (byte-identical
   journal, loud log, no hysteresis state written).

Plus: trigger math on the largest-shard axis, hysteresis
(ineffective → advisory, regrowth → re-arm, hostile state can only
suppress, aborts never arm), tier policy (dedup+supersede automatic,
slim only under the existing consent — no RAPTOR call site passes
it), and two-direction regression tests for every churn-prone
constant.
