"""Checkpoint crash atomicity — the kill matrix.

A child process (``killmatrix_child.py``) runs one journal checkpoint
with a hook planted at a named seam; the hook signals readiness and
hangs, and this parent SIGKILLs it there. Four legs, one per seam of
the compactor's swap protocol:

* ``tmp-write``   — mid pass-2 rewrite (tmp partially written);
* ``pre-rename``  — at the backup hardlink (tmp complete, no backup);
* ``mid-archive`` — between backup hardlink and swap rename;
* ``post-rename`` — after the swap, before cache invalidation and the
  directory fsync.

Every leg asserts the same recovery contract: the live journal is
either the OLD bytes or the NEW bytes, never a mixture; the resume
gate's loader (``require_complete_entries``) accepts it; the journal
spend floor is bit-preserved; any archive that exists holds the full
original bytes; no hysteresis state was written (a killed attempt
must re-fire); and a follow-up compaction succeeds and sweeps any
leaked ``.~compact-*`` tmp file.
