"""Two-direction regression tests for the per-run merge cap and the
merge byte ceiling.

``_MAX_MERGE_ENTRIES`` is sized so legitimate mega-runs reach the
project index as FULL rows (a self-audit measures ~22k distinct
identities; a kernel-scope audit ~10^5) — full rows carry the verdict
detail that cross-run $0 reuse imports, aggregates carry only tallies.
The other direction is bounded by BYTES, not the count cap: the merge
write ceiling sheds a fat run's oldest identities to the aggregates
section instead of freezing the index, so raising the count cap never
re-opens the frozen-index failure the byte gate closed.
