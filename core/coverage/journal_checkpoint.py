"""Mid-audit journal checkpoint — bounded, quiesced, crash-atomic.

The loader's per-shard retained budgets (``core.coverage.journal``)
are a wall: a journal that grows past them mid-run degrades every
read-only consumer to a partial view and refuses the next resume's
spend authorization — historically a manual drain / ``journal
compact`` / resume cycle, paying the full re-init cost (Joern/CPG
reload, prep-cache rebuild, dispatcher restart) for what is seconds
of compaction. This module is the ONE checkpoint implementation all
call sites share:

* **resume-time** (``raptor-audit resume``, segment start) — absorbs
  the former inline segment-start auto-compact;
* **segment boundaries** in the orchestrator (post-review drain,
  post-loop passes) — the executor has returned, workers are joined;
* **quiesce points** inside the review executor — the trigger is
  evaluated at dispatch points during the segment, and when it fires
  the executor stops issuing reviews, drains inflight work (bounded),
  and runs the checkpoint synchronously in its own driving thread
  before resuming dispatch (``core.audit.journal_quiesce``).

TRIGGER: largest single shard over
``_CHECKPOINT_TRIGGER_FRACTION`` of the loader's per-shard retained
byte budget — the same axis the budgets themselves bound, evaluated
by ``stat`` only (never a parse).

TIERS: dedup + supersede run automatically — both are spend-safe by
the compactor's loss contract (protected row classes retained
outright, spend floor re-verified against the written bytes, full
archive per shard). The slim tier moves row CONTENT out of the live
journal and stays under its existing operator consent surface
(``raptor-audit journal compact --slim-clean``); the checkpoint
never widens that consent — ``slim_consent`` exists for callers that
already hold it, no RAPTOR call site passes True today, and the
incompressible-journal advisory routes operators to the existing
command instead.

HYSTERESIS: a checkpoint that freed less than
``_CHECKPOINT_MIN_FREED_FRACTION`` of its input marks the journal
"legitimately large" in the run-dir state record
(:data:`CHECKPOINT_STATE_FILENAME` — run-dir state, not process
memory: segments span processes). Later evaluations do NOT re-fire
until the journal grows by ``_CHECKPOINT_REARM_FRACTION`` of the
budget past the recorded post-checkpoint size — an incompressible
journal of live distinct verdicts must not thrash a full two-pass
rewrite at every boundary; it gets one loud advisory instead.

SAFETY (each pinned in core/coverage/tests/test_journal_checkpoint*):

1. The checkpoint runs SYNCHRONOUSLY in the caller's own thread and
   REFUSES to enter while review work is in flight — an enforced
   guard (:class:`CheckpointBusy` on
   ``core.audit.executor.review_work_inflight() > 0`` or any caller
   busy-probe), not a convention. It is never submitted to the
   executor and never waits on executor-produced state (the
   studywedge self-deadlock class).
2. LOCK ORDER (enforced in :func:`checkpoint_journal`, stated where
   acquired): collector drained and PROVABLY empty → journal state
   read → compactor locks (sidecar flock before the per-shard journal
   flocks — the compactor's own documented order). The checkpoint
   acquires no lock before the collector assertion passes and holds
   no lock while waiting on anything.
3. Foreign appenders (SAGE hooks, subprocesses) blocked across the
   compactor's rename land their rows in the LIVE journal — the
   appender's post-flock inode re-validation
   (``journal.append_entry``).
4. CRASH ATOMICITY: the compactor's tmp + re-parse + rename
   discipline is unchanged; a SIGKILL at any phase leaves the old or
   the new journal COMPLETE, archives intact, spend floor preserved,
   and the run resumable (kill-matrix suite).
5. DRAIN INTERPLAY: the checkpoint is drain-aware — ``should_abort``
   (wired to the orchestrator's SIGTERM request) is polled at entry
   and inside the compactor's abort seams, which all sit OUTSIDE the
   backup+rename window; a signal before the swap aborts with the
   journal byte-identical, a signal after the swap lets the completed
   swap stand. Forced exits (second TERM, watchdog ``os._exit``) are
   the kill-matrix case.
6. CONSUMER INVALIDATION: the compactor drops the process-local load
   cache per swapped shard — one cold reload of the journal per
   checkpoint, and nothing else: no Joern, dispatcher, or prep-cache
   surface is touched (prep-cache doctrine already forbids
   journal-derived fingerprints; the no-restart spy suite pins it).
7. BOUNDED: ``_CHECKPOINT_WALL_BOUND_S`` rides the compactor's
   deadline seams — on exceeding, the current shard aborts
   byte-identical, one loud line, and the run continues to the next
   evaluation. The run never blocks indefinitely on its own hygiene.
