"""_model_write_lock: foreign-uid refusal and bounded waiting.

This lock's contract is raise-on-failure (save_model must not proceed
unserialised), so both hostile shapes fail the save loudly: a
pre-created foreign-uid lock file is never adopted, and a holder that
outlives the bounded wait raises instead of stalling the saver
silently and forever.
