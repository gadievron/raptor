"""Consent resolution for the CLI sandbox disable (`--no-sandbox`).

`--no-sandbox` / `--sandbox none` is reachable by anything that can
compose a command line — including an LLM session assembling a
`python3 raptor.py ...` invocation — and it is globally authoritative
once set. This module supplies the gate that
`core.sandbox.cli._set_cli_state("none")` consults: the disable is a
REQUEST for tier NONE, honoured only when a consent of matching
authority exists. Without one the request is refused loudly (never
silently re-enabled, never downgraded — a refusal, so the operator's
intent is never quietly inverted).

The ONLY consent source is the **minted nonce (per-invocation)**:
``RAPTOR_NO_SANDBOX_NONCE`` carries a 128-bit hex nonce that must
match a mode-0600, uid-owned consent file under the invoking user's
home. A boolean env var would be attacker-typable data (any argv/env
composition could set it); the nonce is only valid when a matching
file exists on disk. Returns ``"nonce"``.

There is deliberately NO interactive-TTY consent arm. Terminal
presence on the process fds carries no authority: a pseudo-terminal
wrapper (``script -qec …``, ``pty.spawn``) gives any composed child
real TTYs on stdin/stderr with no operator present, and the
"pre-existing controlling terminal" signals that might distinguish a
laundered pty from an operator's terminal (session leadership, ctty
coherence, pty age, master-holder ancestry) are all either
manufacturable by the same composer or invalid on real terminal
topologies (terminal multiplexers and sshd hold the pty master from
an ancestor position exactly like a wrapper does). Requiring the
mint instead converts the cheapest bypass from an innocuous-looking
wrapper into an explicit, self-describing, artifact-leaving action.
The gate's honest claim is guardrail-plus-attribution — the
programmatic ``sandbox(disabled=True)`` kwarg is deliberately
ungated, so this was never a boundary against same-uid arbitrary
code execution.

There is deliberately NO standing project consent ("off" is a debug
posture, not a host condition — the project `sandbox-floor` registry
rule "never none" stays exactly as is) and trust markers grant nothing
here (they assert repo provenance, not host-risk acceptance).

Security invariants for the env var:

- It must NOT be added to ``RaptorConfig.SAFE_ENV_ALLOWLIST`` — a
  scanned repo or spawned target must never inherit consent ambiently.
  Propagation across RAPTOR's own worker spine is site-specific and
  explicit (:func:`export_disable_consent`), only from a parent that
  itself holds an accepted consent.
- It IS a member of ``TARGET_ENV_STRIP_SET`` — target-bound envs
  (code under analysis) never see it.
- The consent-file directory derives from ``pwd.getpwuid(...)``, never
  ``$HOME`` — an env-overridden HOME would let a composed command point
  validation at an attacker-staged directory (e.g. inside the scanned
  repo, where the attacker CAN write files).

The unguarded mint path for CI / operators lives OUTSIDE runtime
source by design: ``core/sandbox/scripts/mint-no-sandbox-nonce`` (dev
tool) and the test-suite conftest fixture. The only in-runtime mint is
:func:`export_disable_consent`, which refuses to mint unless the
current process already holds an ACCEPTED consent — it can extend an
existing grant across a spawn boundary, never create one from nothing.

# several spine children validating independently (the agentic parent
