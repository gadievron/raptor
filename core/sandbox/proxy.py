"""Local HTTPS egress proxy for sandboxed subprocesses.

Closes two gaps in the `allowed_tcp_ports=[443]` posture that `cc_dispatch`
and similar Claude-sub-agent callers had to rely on:

1. UDP exfil: Landlock's network rule is TCP-CONNECT only, so a
   compromised sub-agent could previously exfiltrate via DNS/UDP. When
   this proxy is used, callers enable the seccomp UDP block (see
   seccomp.py) — the child has no direct network at all, and every
   outbound connection has to land on the proxy's TCP port, which
   enforces a hostname allowlist.
2. Port-only allowlist: Landlock's TCP allowlist is `(port)` not
   `(host, port)`. A sub-agent with `allowed_tcp_ports=[443]` could
   reach any server on :443, including localhost services (e.g., a
   dev-mode internal HTTPS app). With this proxy, only the proxy's
   ephemeral loopback port is reachable; the proxy validates the
   destination hostname and refuses anything outside the allowlist.

Architecture:
- In-process: runs on a daemon thread inside RAPTOR's Python process.
  No subprocess, no IPC, no lifecycle hooks. Daemon thread terminates
  automatically on interpreter exit; `atexit` handler closes sockets
  as defense-in-depth.
- asyncio event loop in the daemon thread handles many concurrent
  tunnels without thread-per-connection. RAPTOR's main code stays
  fully synchronous — callers just see `get_proxy().port` as an int.
- HTTP CONNECT method only. Proxy tunnels raw TLS bytes between child
  and backend; it does NOT terminate TLS (no MITM, no cert forging).
- Confined request-line parsing: the raw CONNECT request-line bytes —
  the one place hostile bytes from the sandboxed client are
  interpreted — are parsed in a separate, self-confined worker process
  (see parser_jail.py: Landlock read-only-on-own-code, no network,
  rlimits, sanitised environment), never in this process. The worker's
  verdict is re-validated field-by-field before use. If the worker
  cannot be spawned and confined, EgressProxy construction raises and
  mid-life unavailability answers 503 — there is no inline-parse
  fallback. On kernels without Landlock the worker runs on a degraded
  floor (rlimits + fd hygiene + process isolation only); that is made
  loud via a startup warning and a `parser_jail_degraded` audit marker
  in every registration's event buffer.
- Hostname allowlist is UNION across all callers: if cc_dispatch asks
  for {api.anthropic.com} and a later caller asks for {ghcr.io}, both
  hosts are allowed globally. Trust model: RAPTOR's own code is the
  only thing that registers hosts, and all sandboxed children are
  equally untrusted. Per-caller allowlists would require mapping each
  TCP connection back to its originating caller, which isn't worth
  the complexity given the threat model.

Safety hooks baked in:
- Bind: 127.0.0.1 only, NEVER 0.0.0.0. Checked at socket setup.
- Ephemeral port: assigned by the kernel (bind port 0). No collision
  with whatever else is on the box, no well-known port to probe.
- Host validation: resolve the CONNECT target once per tunnel, reject
  if the resolved IP is loopback, private (RFC 1918), link-local, or
  multicast. Stops a compromised child from using the proxy to reach
  internal services on the host's LAN. Applies on BOTH connect paths:
  the direct path vets the addresses we dial; the upstream-proxy path
  vets a literal-IP target outright and pre-vets hostname targets with
  a local resolve before forwarding the CONNECT (residual: the
  upstream proxy resolves independently, so a resolver that answers
  differently for the upstream can still steer the tunnel — see
  _vet_upstream_target).
- DNS pinning: one resolve per tunnel, then connect to that exact IP.
  No mid-tunnel re-resolution — removes the DNS-rebinding window.
- TLS identity peek (best-effort): after the 200, the client's first
  TLS record is peeked; a complete ClientHello whose SNI differs from
  the authorised CONNECT hostname closes the tunnel (cheap domain-
  fronting defence). Non-TLS, SNI-less, fragmented, or inconclusive
  first bytes pass through unchanged and are forwarded verbatim.
- Idle timeout: 300s. Total tunnel duration cap: 3600s. Either bound
  limits how long one compromised child can hold resources open.
- Concurrent tunnels: capped at 4096 (configurable; sized for npm
  install's CONNECT bursts — see _DEFAULT_MAX_TUNNELS history). Hard
  limit on resource consumption by a runaway child.
- Buffer size: 64 KiB per direction. Bounds memory per tunnel.
- Audit log: every CONNECT logs {host, port, result, bytes}, INFO level.
- No Proxy-Authorization: localhost-only bind + same-UID trust model.

HTTP CONNECT protocol (RFC 7231 §4.3.6):
    CONNECT host:port HTTP/1.1\r\n
    Host: host:port\r\n
    (optional headers)\r\n
    \r\n

Response:
    HTTP/1.1 200 Connection established\r\n\r\n
    (then raw bytes in both directions)

Error responses:
    400 Bad Request       — malformed CONNECT line / header budget exceeded
    403 Forbidden         — host not in allowlist OR resolved to blocked IP
    408 Request Timeout   — handshake (request line + headers) exceeded
                            the absolute deadline
    429 Too Many Tunnels  — aggregate tunnel-slot cap reached
    502 Bad Gateway       — backend refused / unreachable
    503 Service Unavailable — confined request-line parser worker
                            unavailable (respawn failing/backing off)
    504 Gateway Timeout   — backend didn't respond within timeout

#         of refused tunnels + retries → 14% of popular npm
#         packages timed out at 90s.
#   256 — first bump (#407). Helped marginally but ``npm install
#         --maxsockets=8`` STILL bursts to ~280 concurrent tunnels
#         because npm install via ``HTTPS_PROXY`` ignores

#         tunnels for ``debug``, peak 298 for ``eslint``.
#   1024 — interim (#411). Looked safe at first; later sampling at

#         655 for ``eslint`` (earlier 250ms-tick samples missed the

    At interpreter/test-harness teardown the stats emitters (summary in
    ``stop()``, heartbeat task) can fire after logging's underlying
    stream (captured stderr, a closed log file) is gone. The
    ``ValueError`` that raises happens INSIDE ``Handler.emit`` — logging
    swallows it via ``Handler.handleError`` and prints a
    "--- Logging error ---" traceback to stderr, so the callers'
    ``contextlib.suppress`` never sees it and the noise lands in test
    output anyway.

    Chosen semantics, on the record:

    - The walk covers the same parent chain ``Logger.callHandlers``
      covers (stopping at ``propagate=False``) and honours per-handler
      LEVEL, so a stale closed handler that would never service the
      record (a CRITICAL-only debug tap left behind by a harness)
      cannot silence INFO stats. Handler FILTERS are deliberately NOT
      consulted — evaluating them needs a built record, and the cost
      of ignoring them is one skipped stats line, never emit noise.
    - A closed handler that WOULD service the record skips the WHOLE
      emit, live sibling handlers included: logging fans one record
      out to every servicing handler under logging's own locks, and
      there is no supported per-handler bypass. A long-lived closed
      handler next to a live one therefore silences the stats trail —
      accepted: losing observability lines beats un-catchable
      "--- Logging error ---" tracebacks in operator/test output, and
      a process in that state has a logging-hygiene bug this guard
      cannot fix.

      on ``.closed``) counts as closed — fail toward skip. The guard

    TCP sockets have no SO_PEERCRED, so the equivalent is asking the
    kernel who owns the peer's socket. Two primitives answer that,
    both reading the same struct-sock owner field (sock_i_uid):

    1. NETLINK_SOCK_DIAG exact-match lookup (primary) — O(1) kernel
       hash lookup by 4-tuple; microseconds, host-socket-count
       independent.
    2. /proc/net/tcp{,6} row scan (fallback, and second opinion on a
       netlink miss) — O(host-sockets); also covers the edge where
       the peer's socket is device-bound and the idiag_if=0 lookup
       misses it. The union keeps this dispatcher a strict semantic
       superset of the historical scan-only behaviour: it can only
       resolve MORE peers, never fewer, so every None still means
       "the kernel shows no established socket for this 4-tuple".

    Returns None when the UID cannot be determined — non-Linux hosts,
    malformed peername tuples, or a socket that vanished because the
    peer closed mid-lookup. The caller's policy on None is
    capability-scoped: on hosts WITH the socket table
    (_PEER_UID_TABLE_AVAILABLE) an undetermined UID is retried once
    and then REFUSED — allowing it let a different-uid local process
    race connect-vs-row-visibility (or exhaust the row scan) to ride
    the proxy's allowlisted egress. On hosts without the table
    (macOS) None is the permanent answer for every peer, honest or
    not, and the gate stays layered defense only (loopback-only bind
    + hostname allowlist). Residual: a same-UID process can still
    hand its connected fd to another principal (SCM_RIGHTS); no
    kernel socket-owner view defends that.

    Synchronous. EgressProxy._lookup_peer_uid is the event-loop-side
    wrapper that decides where this runs: inline while the verdict
    comes from netlink alone (cheap), in a bounded executor whenever
    the /proc scan owes the verdict — scan-only hosts, and the
    netlink-miss / just-latched cases, which the wrapper detects via
    the _INLINE_SCAN_DEFER signal above (the linear read must never
    block the loop, and a hostile peer can force the miss case on
    every connection).

        instead; production code has no callers of this API.

        mixed-profile usage. And vice-versa: an audit-mode set
        would have allowed a non-audit peer's CONNECTs to non-
        allowlisted hosts to slip through.

        so post-mortem filtering can separate, e.g., claude-sub-agent
        traffic from codeql-pack-download even when they share the
        proxy singleton.

        ``lane_key`` scopes the buffer to ONE lane (the unix socket
        path or TCP lane port the caller's sandbox transport rides):
        only events attributed to that lane land in this buffer, so
        concurrent runs no longer see each other's would-deny records.
        With ``lane_key=None`` (default) the buffer is run-global and
        receives every event — the pre-lane behaviour, and the home
        for events that carry no lane attribution (main-listener
        traffic): un-laned events are never dropped from the global
        view, and never leak into lane-scoped views. Handler errors
        and capacity refusals are lane-attributed whenever the
        accepting transport was a lane, so a run's own mid-tunnel
        handler crashes land in its scoped buffer too.

        Fail-open on lookup miss BY DESIGN for the audit trail: a
        ``lane_key`` that matches no live lane degrades to the
        run-global subscription (over-capture, never under-capture) —
        the caller keeps a complete event view rather than a silently
        empty one.

        `host_recon_threshold` (optional): a per-profile override for
        the live host-recon escalation threshold (see
        DEFAULT_HOST_RECON_THRESHOLD). Scoped to this registration's
        recon bucket (the resolved lane, or the run-global bucket for
        lane-less registrations) and min-combined within it: a
        registration passing a looser threshold never weakens an
        already-tighter sibling ON THE SAME bucket — mirrors
        update_idle_timeout's max-semantics, inverted because tighter
        is the more-sensitive direction here. Different lanes keep
        fully independent thresholds, so a debug-profile sandbox never
        loosens (or tightens) a concurrent full-profile run's recon
        sensitivity.

        Must be paired with `unregister_sandbox(token)` — typically via
        try/finally around the sandboxed subprocess invocation. The

        Fan-out rule (design doc D3 — lane-scoped buffers):

          - run-global buffers (registered with ``lane_key=None``)
            receive EVERY event — the pre-lane behaviour;
          - lane-subscribed buffers receive only events whose
            ``lane_id`` matches their subscription, so concurrent
            runs' events segregate;
          - an event with no lane attribution (``lane_id`` absent or
            None: main-listener traffic, including main-listener
            handler errors and capacity refusals) goes to the
            run-global buffers only — never dropped from the global
            view, never leaked into another run's lane view. Handler
            errors and capacity refusals on a LANED transport carry
            that lane's attribution and reach its scoped buffers.

        Each buffer holds a REFERENCE to the same event dict, NOT a
        copy. That's deliberate: the tunnel handler records at CONNECT
        open (so short tunnels completing around subprocess-end still
        appear) and then updates bytes_c2u / bytes_u2c / duration in
        place when the tunnel closes. A record-time copy would freeze
        the event with bytes==0 / duration==initial. Copying is
        deferred to `unregister_sandbox` where we can do it once per
        caller with the caller_label stamp.

        No-op when no sandbox is registered (rare — means the proxy is
        processing a CONNECT that happened outside any register /
        unregister window, e.g. during proxy shutdown).

        Serialised on ``_buffer_lock``: ``unregister_sandbox`` pops
        the buffer and takes its defensive copy under that lock, so
        appending under the same lock means an event either lands
        BEFORE the pop (delivered in the returned copy) or the
        recorder observes the post-unregister snapshot (the buffer is
        gone; nothing to deliver). The previous lock-free snapshot
        read left a window where a recorder holding the pre-pop
        snapshot appended AFTER the copy — the sandbox's final audit
        event (e.g. a denied CONNECT racing context exit) landed on
        the orphaned list and silently vanished from the persisted
        evidence. _record runs once per CONNECT (never per relayed
        byte), so this is a cold path and the lock cost is noise;
        the snapshot tuple is still maintained by register/unregister
        for cheap introspection, but the fan-out no longer trusts it

        Returns the offending address when the CONNECT must be denied,
        or None when it may be forwarded to the upstream. Pre-fix the
        upstream branch forwarded every allowlist-passing CONNECT with
        NO IP vetting at all — a child on a corporate-proxy host could
        CONNECT to ``10.0.0.5:443`` or ``169.254.169.254:443`` and the
        upstream (which legitimately reaches private space) would
        happily complete the pivot that gate 2 exists to stop.

        Two cases:

        - literal-IP target: judged directly by ``_ip_is_blocked`` —
          no resolver involved, no TOCTOU, unconditional.
        - hostname target: resolved LOCALLY and every returned address
          is vetted; any blocked record denies the CONNECT
          (fail-closed on mixed public/private answers, because we
          cannot control which record the upstream dials).

        Documented residual (TOCTOU vs the upstream resolver): the
        upstream proxy resolves the hostname independently, so a DNS
        server that answers differently for the upstream (split-horizon
        or an active rebinding attack timed between our resolve and
        the upstream's) can still steer the tunnel to a private
        address from the upstream's vantage point. Closing that fully
        would require the upstream to accept pre-resolved IP CONNECTs,
        which HTTP proxies do not offer. Local resolution failure
        (NXDOMAIN/timeout) proceeds WITH a warning rather than
        denying: on locked-down corporate networks external names
        often resolve only at the upstream proxy, and failing closed
        there would break the entire upstream path. In that case the
        upstream proxy's own egress policy is the remaining control.

        Like the direct-path gate 2, this is ENFORCING in audit mode
        too — an allowlisted target vetting to a private/loopback/
        metadata address is purely an attack signal, never a
        legitimate-workflow false positive.

        While NETLINK_SOCK_DIAG is usable the module-level
        _loopback_peer_uid runs inline: the exact-match query is an
        O(1) kernel lookup, cheaper than an executor hop. The inline
        call is armed via _INLINE_SCAN_DEFER, so on a netlink miss
        (or a structural failure that just latched netlink off) the
        dispatcher reports "scan still owed" instead of walking /proc
        on the loop — a peer doing connect-then-reset churn can force
        that miss on every CONNECT, and the O(host-sockets) walk
        must never be loop-blocking on demand.

        Whenever the scan owes the verdict — scan-only hosts, and the
        miss/just-latched cases above — the full dispatcher runs in
        the default executor, bounded by _PEER_SCAN_MAX_CONCURRENCY
        so a connection burst cannot occupy every executor worker
        with table scans. (The executor re-runs the whole dispatcher,
        so a socket whose row appears late still gets the cheap
        netlink answer there before the scan.)

        Every branch resolves the verdict through the module-global
        _loopback_peer_uid name (tests monkeypatch that seam; the
        verdict policy in _handle_client must see the patched answers
        either way). A patched fake never arms the defer signal's
        pending flag, so its answer — including None — is final and
        never triggers the executor re-run.

        Observability: outcomes and permit contention fold into the
        _stats counters (see __init__). Every increment below runs on
        the event-loop thread — the executor scan's RESULT is consumed
        here, after the await — so no locking is needed. `stats` is
        looked up defensively because tests exercise this method as an
        unbound function against a minimal namespace carrying only
        `_peer_scan_sem`; counting is best-effort observability and
        must never change the verdict path.

        Termination contract — the guarantee is that a closed client
        (or backend) propagates across the relay instead of parking
        the tunnel until an idle timeout reaps it:

        * src EOF → half-close *dst* (``write_eof``): the far side

          answers/closes, the sibling direction sees EOF or a write
          error, and the tunnel completes.

        """Progress-aware absolute cap on an established tunnel.

        Waits for *relay* (the gathered ``_relay`` pair) to finish on
        its own (EOF, peer reset, per-direction idle) and returns
        ``None``; a relay exception propagates to the caller unchanged.
        When the cap condition fires — ``total_timeout`` elapsed AND no
        relay progress within the last idle window — the relay pair is
        cancelled and the reason string is returned.

        Security posture — why the cap exists and why progress-aware
        is consistent with it:

        * The absolute cap is a DoS bound on hostile tunnels, not a
          lifetime policy for healthy ones. The per-direction idle
          timeout in :meth:`_relay` already reaps tunnels that go
          silent, but its read-side timer cannot see a stuck
          ``dst.drain()`` — a peer that accepts a chunk into the
          kernel buffer and then never reads parks the writing
          direction forever with zero progress and no idle read to
          trip. Without the cap such a tunnel holds two sockets plus
          relay state indefinitely. That hard ceiling remains: a
          no-progress tunnel dies once the cap elapses, and a tunnel
          that stalls after the cap dies within about two idle windows
          of its last progress (sampling granularity below).
        * A tunnel still making progress past the cap is, by
          definition, live traffic to a gate-1/gate-2-vetted upstream
          (allowlisted hostname, resolved-IP checked at CONNECT).
          Severing it buys no containment — the client simply
          reconnects and the transferred-bytes budget resets — while
          it reliably breaks the legitimate long-lived case: pooled
          LLM connections carry multi-hour request streams (observed
          35-48MB per tunnel over a 12h audit) and a mid-request sever
          forces a full retry at wall-clock and token cost. Operators
          tune client-side stream timeouts on the assumption the
          proxy is not the binding constraint on active transfers.
        * The resource-exhaustion bound is therefore unchanged in
          shape: to survive past the cap a tunnel must keep relaying
          bytes at least once per idle window, i.e. keep behaving like
          traffic. Idle-parked and drain-stuck tunnels cannot.

        Progress is sampled from the shared byte-counter dict at least
        once per idle window, so "no progress within the last idle
        window" is judged conservatively in the tunnel's favour — a
        byte relayed at any point between two samples credits the
        later sample's time. The idle width is re-read under
        ``_idle_timeout_lock`` each wake so ``update_idle_timeout``'s
        max-semantics widening applies to tunnels already in flight.

    """Return the process-wide proxy singleton, creating it on first call.

    Additional calls mutate the allowlist in place (UNION semantics) and
    return the same serving instance. Thread-safe. Invalid caller inputs
    are rejected before changing existing configuration. A stopped proxy
    is retired before replacement; incomplete cleanup remains owned and
    raises RuntimeError so callers can retry rather than share a dying loop.
    New activation failures roll back the loop and its exact exit callback.

    *idle_timeout* widens the per-tunnel idle timeout via max semantics:
    on first call it overrides the default (300s); on subsequent calls
    it raises the singleton's timeout if the new value is higher.
    Callers that need longer tunnels (e.g. LLM thinking models) pass
    their own timeout; callers that don't care omit it and get the
    default or whatever a previous caller already raised it to.

    Upstream proxy autodetect: reads HTTPS_PROXY / https_proxy and
    NO_PROXY / no_proxy from the parent process env at FIRST-CALL time.
    If set, the singleton tunnels through that upstream for every
    outbound connection (except hosts matching NO_PROXY, which connect
    directly). This lets RAPTOR work inside corporate networks where
    direct egress is blocked but an outbound HTTPS proxy is mandatory.
    The upstream and no_proxy are captured once — subsequent env
    mutation doesn't reconfigure the running proxy.
