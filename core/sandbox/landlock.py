"""Landlock filesystem + network + scoping restriction.

Landlock works without mount namespaces, without privileges, and without
AppArmor exceptions. It restricts filesystem access via syscall filtering.

ABI levels (kernel):
- 1 (5.13+)  : basic filesystem write restriction (incl. REMOVE_*)
- 2 (5.19+)  : + REFER (cross-directory rename/link)
- 3 (6.2+)   : + TRUNCATE (O_TRUNC on existing files)
- 4 (6.7+)   : + NET_CONNECT_TCP (TCP allowlist / deny-all fallback)
- 5 (6.10+)  : + IOCTL_DEV (device ioctl restriction)
- 6 (6.12+)  : + scoping (signal + abstract Unix socket isolation)
- 7 (6.15+)  : audit log flags on restrict_self — not used (RAPTOR has
               its own ptrace/seccomp audit pipeline)
- 8          : TSYNC (restrict all threads) — not needed (Landlock is
               always applied in a freshly forked, single-threaded
               child before exec)
- 10         : UDP bind + connect/send restrictions, requested only as
               an additional layer where policy already denies UDP

We build the access masks at runtime based on the kernel's ABI, so
a newer kernel gives more coverage; an older one degrades cleanly.

         on failure.
      2. Functional self-test: fork a child and walk the ENTIRE install

    Runs in a forked child: performs the same install the enforcement
    closure (_make_landlock_preexec) performs — full 3-field ruleset

    add_rule (a read+exec grant on a fresh probe directory, the same

    Why this design:
      - Fork so the parent (RAPTOR) stays unrestricted.
      - Same-shape install: the probe exists to predict the closure's

        consented degraded tier was the correct outcome.
      - Probe artifacts (file + grant dir) are created HERE in the

        REMOVE_FILE/REMOVE_DIR, so the restricted child cannot unlink
        its own droppings.

        executing attacker-controlled binaries (PoC exec) where the
        risk of credential-exfil via read-everywhere outweighs the
        tool-compatibility cost.
      - restricted reads also engage EXEC scoping: the EXECUTE right
        (ABI v1) is handled, granted on the readable DIRECTORY rules
        (except /proc and /sys) and on the writable rules, denied
        everywhere else. This makes exec-denial an explicit policy
        rather than a side effect of the exec-open's FMODE_READ, and
        covers the on-filesystem fileless spellings (O_TMPFILE /
        unlinked inodes inherit their directory's hierarchy). It can
        NOT cover memfd — kernel-internal SB_NOUSER mounts are exempt
        from Landlock rules (live-verified) — which is closed at the
        seccomp layer (deny_fd_exec).

    Network (ABI v4+): if allowed_tcp_ports is set, restricts TCP connect
    to those ports only. If `deny_all_tcp_connect` is set (and no port
    allowlist is), CONNECT_TCP is handled with ZERO allow rules — every
    TCP connect (loopback included; Landlock net rules are port-scoped,
    not address-scoped) fails with EACCES. TCP bind/listen is untouched.
    `deny_all_udp` additionally handles UDP bind and connect/send on
    ABI10+, with no UDP grants. It supplements the existing seccomp
    UDP filter; it never waives that requirement on older kernels.
    Namespace-local UDP remains allowed when this request is false.
    When only network denial is requested (no writable
    paths, no read restriction, no port allowlist), the ruleset handles
    ONLY the net access — filesystem semantics stay exactly as without
    Landlock, so a net-only deny never sneaks in fs restrictions.

    Device ioctl (ABI v5+): blanket-denied on all device files.

    Scoping (ABI v6+): signal delivery and abstract Unix socket connections
    restricted to processes within the same Landlock domain. Always-on
    when the kernel supports it.

    fail_raise: fail-closed reporting mode. False (default, preexec_fn
    lane) keeps the async-signal-safe ``os.write(2) + os._exit(126)``
    aborts. True (mount-ns spawn grandchild) raises
    ``LandlockInstallError`` after the stderr line instead, so the
    spawn chain's setup-status pipe reports 'L' + the reason and the
    parent raises a typed SandboxSetupError — pre-fix these aborts
    bypassed the status pipe and surfaced as an unattributed child
    exit 126, indistinguishable from a target that chose that code.
