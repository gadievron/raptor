"""Capability skip-guards for feature-assuming sandbox tests.

The feature-matrix harness (core/sandbox/scripts/feature-matrix/) runs
this suite on hosts that GENUINELY lack kernel sandbox features —
Landlock faked to ENOSYS, unprivileged user namespaces denied. Tests
that exercise a capability (rather than the degradation behaviour in
its absence) fail there by hitting the sandbox's own designed
refusals: SandboxSetupError fail-closed gates, Landlock install
fail-raise, the block_network refusal. Those failures are noise that
buries real degradation regressions.

These markers make degraded lanes report honestly: the designed
outcome for a feature-exercising test on a feature-less host is a SKIP
with the missing capability named; a FAILURE is signal. On
feature-complete hosts (every other CI tier) the conditions are all
False and the marks are inert — nothing is skipped that ran before.

Availability comes from the sandbox's own once-per-process cached
probes — the same verdicts the production degradation lattice keys on,
so a test skips exactly where production refuses.

    the PID-namespace unshare included — hangs off that verdict.
    When it is False the sandbox runs in the Landlock-only posture:
    host processes stay VISIBLE in ``/proc`` (enumeration and
    world-readable entries like ``cmdline``), but out-of-domain
    ``/proc/<pid>/environ`` / ``mem`` reads are still denied by the
    sandbox's own Landlock ptrace scoping — the Landlock domain
    gates the kernel's ptrace-mode access checks those files
    require, on any Yama setting (Yama gates only ptrace ATTACH,
    never the READ check environ opens use). What the posture loses
    is PID hiding, so a test guarding the PID-namespace hiding
    behaviour has nothing to measure and skips on this verdict with
