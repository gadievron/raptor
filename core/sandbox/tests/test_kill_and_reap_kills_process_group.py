"""Regression test for ``_kill_and_reap`` process-group kill.

Pre-fix `_kill_and_reap` only SIGKILLed the direct child PID (the
session leader). Descendants spawned via setsid+fork (e.g. codeql
java → python tracer → multiprocessing forkserver workers) inherited
init as their parent and kept running for weeks. Operators discovered
5 wedged codeql trees still alive 29 days after their parent died,
together holding ~4 CPU-hours.

Fix: ``_kill_and_reap`` now also calls ``os.killpg(pid, SIGKILL)`` to
sweep the leader's process group, killing all descendants in the
same session.

This test pins that fix by:
  1. Spawning a Python child via ``subprocess.Popen(start_new_session=True)``
     so the child becomes a session leader (PGID == its PID).
  2. The child forks its own grandchild that prints its PID then
     sleeps for 60 seconds (long enough to outlive any reasonable
     test timeout).
  3. Parent reads the grandchild PID, then calls ``_kill_and_reap``
     on the child.
  4. Asserts both child AND grandchild are gone within 2 seconds.
