"""Pytest fixtures for the sandbox test module.

The sandbox module has several pieces of process-level global state that
can leak between tests if a setUp/tearDown is forgotten or fails. We
snapshot them before every test and restore afterwards as a safety net
— individual tests are still free to mutate them deliberately.

    routinely exceeds that once a socket name is appended (macOS:

    unix sockets must derive their socket paths from this fixture

    Several proxy tests use ``.invalid`` hostnames as guaranteed-failing
    resolve targets. The GUARANTEE is only about the outcome — the
    latency and exception detail come from the host's live resolver,
    and platform resolvers differ wildly: glibc fails an NXDOMAIN
    immediately, while macOS (search-domain retries through
    mDNSResponder) has been observed taking longer than a test client's
    5s read budget, so the proxy's 502 arrived after the client gave
    up. Stub the proxy's resolve seam for ``.invalid`` names — instant
    gaierror, no resolver in the loop — and delegate every other name
    (e.g. ``localhost``, literal IPs) to the real lookup.

    The patch MUST go through the shared ``monkeypatch`` fixture, not a
    manual save/restore: tests layer their own ``monkeypatch.setattr``
    on the same class attribute, and a manual ``finally`` restore runs
    BEFORE that monkeypatch's undo — which then re-installs the value
    it saved at setattr time (this fixture's stub), leaking the stub
    onto the class for the rest of the process. One shared undo stack
    unwinds LIFO and always lands back on the pristine method (the
