"""Tests for core.sandbox.exec_stage — consented-exec staging.

Env-built artifacts sit 0444 in the run dir (core/env/build.py strips
the exec bits deliberately). ``executable_stage`` must yield a runnable
private copy for those without ever touching the original, and must be
a pass-through for everything else.
