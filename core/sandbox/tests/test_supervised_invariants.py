"""Adversarial invariant battery for core.sandbox.supervised —
hermetic on any Linux host.

Each test pins one load-bearing contract of the supervised-tree
machinery from the outside: the ready-protocol acceptance predicate,
the PDEATHSIG identities, the group-tier refusal/corroboration ladder,
the boot-report channel, fd custody, and the loud-failure paths. The
tests follow test_supervised.py's conventions: the pidns-tier topology
runs REAL processes with ``_ns_setup`` no-opped, so no unshare
permission is needed.

Fleet-kill doctrine: no test signals a pid or pgid <= 1, every pid
signalled here came from a spawn this test performed, and every
teardown is verified (kill-0 / ProcessLookupError / state Z) rather
than assumed.
