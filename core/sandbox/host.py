"""Persistent-sandbox host — parent-side handle.

Keeps a long-lived sandboxed daemon alive so multiple spawn/probe
calls share ONE sandbox + Python startup instead of paying it per
call.

Rendezvous: none — the RPC channel is a pair of inherited pipe fds.
The parent creates two pipe pairs (``os.pipe()``; CLOEXEC by default
per PEP 446) and hands the two DAEMON-side ends to the sandbox spawn
via ``pass_fds`` — subprocess clears CLOEXEC on exactly those fds in
the spawned child, so they survive the exec chain (unshare → pid-1
shim → daemon) while every other parent fd stays closed.  Their fd
numbers ride on the daemon's argv (``--rpc-in-fd N --rpc-out-fd M``);
the daemon opens nothing by path.  No filesystem name exists for the
channel, so a hostile target inside the sandbox has nothing to squat,
replace, symlink-swap, or open — the forged-verdict / injected-request
races that path-named FIFOs in the sandbox-writable target directory
allowed are impossible by construction.

Pipes (rather than AF_UNIX sockets) because seccomp:full blocks
``socket()`` — env parity with parse_result requires the daemon to
run under the same profile the target does.  The seccomp filter is a
blocklist that leaves ``pipe``/``pipe2`` alone, and the daemon's own
use of the channel needs only ``read``/``write``/``close`` at
runtime, all of which pass the filter.

Once the startup ping proves the daemon is alive, the parent closes
its copies of the daemon-side ends — from then on EOF on the read
end means the daemon (or its whole sandbox chain) died.  This
replaces the FIFO-open timeout dance the path-based rendezvous
needed.  ``pass_fds`` also routes the spawn down the
subprocess+preexec path (context.py's ``spawn_eligible`` gate —
the mount-ns fork chain doesn't plumb inherited fds); net-ns,
Landlock, seccomp and the pid-ns shim all still apply.

Threading: ``core.sandbox.run`` is blocking, so a background
thread holds the sandbox open.  The parent-side handle uses the
pipe fds for RPC while the thread parks in the sandbox call for
the host's lifetime.  ``close()`` terminates cleanly.

Wiring checklist — this docstring is the successor to the pre-wiring
design note; the module still has zero production callers.  Before
the first caller (the /exploit knowledge loop, which treats this
channel's verdicts as ground truth) wires in:

- Inherited-pipe-fd transport replacing the FIFO rendezvous — LANDED
  (this revision).
- ``_safe_eval`` node-allowlist trim in the daemon — LANDED.
- Hostile-peer e2e (``core/sandbox/tests/test_host_rpc.py``): no
  rendezvous path artifacts under the target dir, forged-verdict
  write and request-stream read from a daemon-spawned child both
  fail with EBADF, daemon death surfaces as EOF, ``close()`` leaks
  no fds.  These exist and must stay green.

The companion daemon script lives at ``core/sandbox/_daemon.py``
— pure stdlib, no external deps.
