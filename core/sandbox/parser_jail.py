"""Parent-side manager for the confined request-line parser worker.

The egress proxy (``proxy.py``) never parses raw CONNECT request-line
bytes in-process: it hands them to a long-lived jailed child
(``_parser_jail_child.py``) over a socketpair and consumes a validated
struct back. This module owns that child: spawn, confinement handshake,
the framed round-trip, re-validation of everything the child returns,
crash containment, and respawn with backoff.

Trust model: the child parses HOSTILE bytes, so the child itself is
treated as compromisable — every field of every verdict is re-validated
here (types, lengths, charset, ranges) before the proxy consumes it,
and any protocol deviation (bad frame, id desync, unsolicited output,
field violation) kills the worker and denies the request. The parent never interprets
the raw request-line bytes itself: there is NO inline-parse fallback.
If the worker cannot be spawned and confined, ``get_parser_jail()``
raises and the proxy refuses to serve (fail-closed).

Singleton: one worker per orchestrator process, shared by every
EgressProxy construction (production has one proxy; tests construct
many, and the parse worker carries no per-proxy state — it is a pure
bytes→struct function). Round-trips are mutex-serialised: a parse is
microseconds of CPU plus one socketpair round-trip, CONNECT handshakes
are per-tunnel (never per-byte), so a single serialised worker
outpaces any realistic CONNECT rate; a pool would add correlation and
respawn complexity for no measurable win. The proxy calls
``parse()`` via ``asyncio.to_thread`` so the blocking round-trip never
occupies its event loop.

Degraded floor: on kernels without Landlock the child still gets
rlimits, fd hygiene, a sanitised environment, and process isolation —
but the parent makes that LOUD (one warning per worker generation
here; an audit marker row per sandbox registration in the proxy).
Landlock available-but-failing is not degraded — it is fail-closed
(the child reports the install error and exits; spawn fails).
