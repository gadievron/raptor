"""``extract_to_dir`` — safely unpack a Tier-1 archive into a directory.

Delegates to the hardened ``core.zip`` / ``core.tar`` primitives (which already
do zip-slip + bomb defense and filter to regular files), writing member bytes
to disk under ``dest`` and re-validating each path stays inside ``dest``. Tar
paths stream: members go straight from the primitive to a disk-writing sink,
so peak memory is one member — never the aggregate budget. Only regular files
are ever created — no symlinks or device nodes — so symlink-escape attacks are
impossible by construction.
