"""Identity-pin bracket at the edge-extraction seam.

The classify pass re-verifies a project-store binary's identity pin
bracketing its tool runs (``test_binary_oracle_identity_pins``); the
edge extractor (`extract_direct_call_edges`) reads the SAME path by
name — r2 inside its sandbox, plus content-keyed cache lookups whose
keys are themselves derived by name — so a swap landing after the
witness read would let unverified bytes plant positive-reachability
edges under the pinned path's authority. The bracket withholds edges
(empty index — the module's documented 'no binary evidence' shape)
on any pin failure; it never refuses the run and never touches
unpinned paths.

Swaps are driven deterministically at the seams (ordering hooks, not
timing races). The bracket-internal tests patch the extraction body
seam and skip on trees that predate it; the launch-refusal test runs
on any tree (red on BASE: the recorder observes the r2 launch the
gate should have withheld).
