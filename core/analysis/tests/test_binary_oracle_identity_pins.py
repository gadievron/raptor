"""Identity-pin verification at the enrichment seam (fd-honest
witness consumption).

The project-store content witness is verified at load time on an open
fd; these tests cover the OTHER half of the window: the oracle's
classify tools re-open the binary BY NAME, so a swap landing between
the witness read and the classify pass would let unverified bytes
drive ``absent``-verdict suppression. The pin — ``(st_dev, st_ino,
st_size, sha256)`` recorded from the very fd the witness hash ran on
— is re-verified bracketing the classify pass, and any failure
DEMOTES the binary (enrichment continues at hint tier; suppression
authority is stripped) rather than refusing the run.

Hermetic: ``classify_binary_evidence`` is mocked (no toolchain, no
sandbox), so the tests exercise exactly the bracket + demotion
plumbing.

Residual stated honestly: the classify tools open by name, so a
swap-in/swap-back pair completing entirely within the classify pass
evades both bracket checks; these tests plant LINGERING swaps.
