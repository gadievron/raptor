"""Containerized repo builds with artifact extraction.

The build-on-demand seam for consumers that need a COMPILED artifact
from a source tree (/validate Stage E feasibility, the mitigation
matrix, future instrumented builds): copy the repo into a build
context, run the build command inside a container (build systems
execute repo-influenced code — the container IS the containment), and
extract the produced ELF executables from the image.

Failure posture: a build failure is a structured outcome, never an
exception — every consumer degrades to its no-binary behaviour with
the reason recorded. Complex projects whose dependencies the default
build image lacks simply fail here and the caller proceeds as today.

Hardening variants: the canonical mitigation-matrix postures are
expressed as :class:`~core.env.spec.ToolchainSpec` values whose flags
are injected via ``CFLAGS``/``CXXFLAGS``/``LDFLAGS`` prepended to the
build command — effective for well-behaved make/cmake builds; a build
that ignores the ambient flags produces a variant whose posture the
analyzer then measures as unchanged (the matrix reports what the
binary IS, not what we asked for).

    :func:`core.build.resolve.resolve_build_command` — a detector-
    synthesized command for a build system living in a subdirectory
    (GNU screen's autotools live in src/) fails at the root. It cannot
    be folded into *command* as ``cd <subdir> && `` because the
    toolchain/env prefix would then apply to the ``cd`` only.

    ``run_env``: extra KEY=VALUE pairs prefixed to the build RUN line
    (e.g. AFL_USE_ASAN=1 — instrumentation toggles the wrapper compiler
    reads from its environment). Values are shell-quoted; keys must be
    identifier-shaped.

    ``aux_builds``: additional same-source build stages, mapping a
    sibling directory name (e.g. "src-cmplog") to its own extra env.
    Each stage runs the SAME command with the toolchain prefix, the
    stage's env ONLY (``run_env`` is not inherited: the canonical
    cmplog twin wants compare logging without the main stage's
    sanitizer — see the in-function comment for the version hazard
    this depends on). Aux artifacts stay in the image/rootfs; only
    /src artifacts are extracted.

    ``keep_rootfs``: when set, the exported image filesystem is written
    there and survives the call (``product.rootfs``) for
    ``sandbox(rootfs=...)`` consumers — in-image fuzzing runs the built
    binary against the exact toolchain runtime that produced it. The
    directory is LARGE (the full flattened image, potentially millions
    of inodes): point it at disk-backed run storage, never a tmpfs,
    and delete it when the run is done. The path must not already
    exist. Partial exports stay in private sibling scratch until the
    build succeeds; failures reclaim only this call's scratch.

    Never raises for build-class failures; see :class:`BuildProduct`.
