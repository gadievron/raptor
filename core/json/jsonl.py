"""Append-only JSONL trail helpers.

RAPTOR keeps several append-only audit trails (``suppressions.jsonl``,
``promotion-alarms.jsonl``, ``.audit-log.jsonl``, sandbox denial logs,
coverage manifests). Each used to re-implement "append one JSON line"
with inconsistent hardening: some writers used ``O_NOFOLLOW`` (the
sandbox observe log), others opened the path bare — so a symlink
planted at a predictable trail path inside a writable run dir was
followed, redirecting the append to an arbitrary file.

This module is the one hardened implementation:

- ``O_APPEND`` + a single ``os.write`` keeps concurrent writers
  line-atomic (POSIX guarantees atomic appends for writes below
  PIPE_BUF-ish sizes on regular files; every record here is small).
- ``O_NOFOLLOW`` refuses symlinked trail paths (fails with ELOOP)
  on both the write and the read side, mirroring the trust contract
  of ``core/sandbox/observe_profile._iter_records``.
- ``O_CLOEXEC`` keeps the fd out of spawned children.
- ``O_NONBLOCK`` plus a post-open ``fstat`` regularity check on the
  write side refuses a planted FIFO: an ``O_WRONLY`` open of a
  reader-less FIFO otherwise blocks the appending process forever,
  and a FIFO with a reader would silently swallow the record. Same
  discipline as the coverage journal's lock open.

``append_jsonl`` raises ``OSError`` (including ELOOP for a rejected
symlink); best-effort callers wrap it. ``load_jsonl`` is best-effort
by contract: missing/unreadable/symlinked files load as ``[]`` and
malformed lines are skipped, because a partial trailing line (writer
killed mid-append) must not lose every well-formed record before it.

    Best-effort: a missing, unreadable, symlinked, or non-regular file
    (FIFO/device — refused on the OPENED fd, with ``O_NONBLOCK`` so a
    reader-less FIFO cannot block the open; same discipline as
    ``append_jsonl``) loads as ``[]``; blank and malformed lines are
    skipped so
    a truncated final line (writer killed mid-append) doesn't lose the
    well-formed records before it. Invalid UTF-8 counts as malformed
    at LINE granularity: the file is read as bytes and each line is
    decoded independently, so one corrupt byte (torn write, foreign
    writer) skips only its own line instead of raising
    ``UnicodeDecodeError`` out of the strict text-mode read and losing
    every well-formed record in the trail. Callers that only want
    objects filter with ``isinstance(rec, dict)`` on the result.

    Byte budgets (keyword-only, ``None`` = historical unbounded):

    - ``max_total_bytes``: ``fstat`` size gate on the opened fd BEFORE
      any read; an oversize trail loads as ``[]`` with a warning —
      nothing is buffered. Reads stop at the admitted initial byte extent,
      so concurrent appends cannot extend bounded read or parse work. This
      bounds the extent rather than providing an atomic file snapshot.
    - ``max_line_bytes``: an over-long line is skipped like a
      malformed one. The check runs after the line is materialised,
      so pair it with ``max_total_bytes`` for a hard memory bound.
    - ``oversize_tail``: changes the ``max_total_bytes`` overflow arm
      from refuse-whole (``[]``) to a bounded NEWEST-tail read: seek
      to ``size - max_total_bytes``, discard through the first
      newline (the seek lands mid-line), then parse normally. The
      budget still binds — at most ``max_total_bytes`` bytes are ever
      read — but a legitimately overgrown trail degrades to its
      newest records instead of vanishing. Trade-off, both
      directions: without the flag a trail one byte over budget
      silently loses EVERY record (an over-review/telemetry-blackout
      cliff a production multi-segment trail actually fell off);
      with it a hostile multi-GiB plant still costs only one
      budget's worth of read+parse work. Callers whose consumers need
      oldest-first completeness must not set it — they get the loud
      refusal instead.
    - ``max_records``: retained-record COUNT bound; the NEWEST
      records win (a byte budget alone does not bound reader memory —
      parsed-object overhead is per record, so a flood of minimal
      rows under the byte budget can still retain millions of
      objects). Trade-off, both directions: too low and a legitimate
      dense trail loses its oldest records (the safe over-review
      direction — every consumer of these trails treats a missing
      record as "not yet done"); unbounded and the tiny-row flood
      OOMs the reader through object overhead the byte budgets
      cannot see. Newest-wins (not stop-early) so last-row-per-key
      consumers keep seeing the true last row.

    A negative budget raises ``ValueError`` before the file is
    opened: budgets are caller-supplied constants, not trail data,
    so the best-effort contract does not swallow them.

    Lines parse through the shared ``core.json`` backend (orjson when
    installed — trail loops are its best-measured win). Non-finite
    constants (``NaN``/``Infinity``) make a line malformed on BOTH
    backends: orjson rejects them natively, and the stdlib branch is
    pinned to the same behaviour via ``_reject_non_finite`` so which
    records survive never depends on which backend is installed.
    (``append_jsonl`` refuses to emit them — ``allow_nan=False`` —
    so only a foreign writer can put one in a trail.)
