"""Per-run lifecycle integration for ``LLMDispatcher``.

Constructs a dispatcher tied to a RAPTOR run directory: the audit log
lands at ``<run_dir>/audit-llm-dispatcher.jsonl``, the dispatcher's
``run_id`` is the run dir's RESOLVED basename
(``core.coverage.journal.resolved_run_id``), and shutdown is wired through
either ``atexit`` (when used directly) or the context-manager exit
(when used via :func:`llm_dispatcher_in_run`).

Construction is opt-in. ``start_run`` does NOT spin one up
automatically — only callers that want credential isolation reach
for this helper, so the dispatcher's daemon thread doesn't spawn
unnecessarily for runs that don't dispatch any LLM calls.
