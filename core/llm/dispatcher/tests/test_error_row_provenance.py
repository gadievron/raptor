"""In-flight provenance on the relay's failure-path audit rows.

Pre-fix ``request.error`` rows were flat — event/status/reason only —
so trail readers could not separate "relay belatedly noticing a worker
that had already left" (long in-flight, response never started) from a
genuine mid-response loss. The rows now carry ``response_started``
(had the worker-facing response begun — the same condition that
selects the mid-stream abort path over the stamped 502) and
``elapsed_s`` (monotonic seconds since the upstream send began), as
EXTRA KEYS ONLY: the classic row shape is unchanged for existing
consumers, which filter parsed rows by the ``event`` field.

Hermetic — captive loopback upstream, no LLM, no network.
