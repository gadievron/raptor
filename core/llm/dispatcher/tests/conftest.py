"""Shared fixtures for dispatcher tests.

Proxy-env hermeticity: these tests spin up loopback fake upstreams
(Bedrock runtime doubles, provider echo servers) and forward to them
through the dispatcher's httpx client, which honours proxy env
(trust_env). On a mandatory-egress-proxy host the live HTTPS_PROXY in
the test process routed every "upstream" call to the corporate proxy
— which cannot reach this machine's loopback — so 30 tests failed
with 403s / missing captures while passing on unproxied machines.

Scrub the whole conventional proxy family for every test in this
directory. Tests that exercise proxy propagation explicitly (e.g.
test_f085_spawn_default_env) re-set the vars with monkeypatch inside
the test body, which runs after this autouse fixture — unaffected.

Same class of fix as the hermetic-proxy-host-tests patch (see
core/orchestration/tests/test_agentic_passes.py).

AWS-env hermeticity, same reasoning: CredentialStore reads the
ambient env at construction and deliberately prefers a profile chain
(AWS_PROFILE — refresh-capable) over explicit keys. On a
Bedrock-configured host that made the SigV4 signing tests resolve the
host's REAL credentials through a network-touching botocore chain
instead of the seeded fakes — signature assertions failed (or hung
once the proxy env was scrubbed). Tests seed exactly the credentials
they mean to test; the ambient family is noise here.

# serve_forever() shutdown-notice poll, for every socketserver these
# tests spin up (the dispatcher's worker/child/TCP planes AND the
# captive upstream doubles): socketserver's serve_forever only checks
# for shutdown() every ``poll_interval``, so each server thread pays
# up to one interval of pure wall-clock wait at teardown. At the
# stdlib default (0.5s) with three-plus servers per test, that wait
# was the single largest cost of this battery (~0.7s of nearly every
# dispatcher test). The knob bounds ONLY shutdown-notice latency —
# request handling is selector-driven and wakes immediately — so
# shrinking it weakens nothing the tests assert.
#
# 0.02s, both directions: TOO LOW (sub-millisecond) has every idle
# server thread busy-spinning its selector for the length of each
# test, which under ``-n auto`` is real contention; TOO HIGH
# re-inserts per-server teardown latency (0.1s would already put
# ~0.3s back on every dispatcher-constructing test). Production code
# is untouched: it keeps the stdlib default, and this wrapper lives

# AF_UNIX hermeticity: every real-dispatcher test binds two Unix
# sockets under a ``tempfile.mkdtemp(prefix="raptor-llm-<run_id>-")``
# dir, and Linux caps a socket path at 108 bytes (sun_path, incl. NUL).
# The session-wide TMPDIR containment (root conftest) nests scratch
# one level deeper, and on hosts whose ambient TMPDIR is itself a
# nested per-session dir the combined prefix pushes
# ``.../raptor-llm-<run_id>-XXXXXXXX/llm-child.sock`` past the cap —
# every dispatcher construction then dies with "AF_UNIX path too
# long" while short-/tmp hosts (CI) pass. Budget below the cap for
# the dispatcher's own suffix: "/raptor-llm-" + run_id (headroom 40;
# longest in this dir is 31) + "-XXXXXXXX" + "/llm-child.sock".
# Every quantity here is BYTES of the fsencoded path — the unit the
# kernel compares sun_path in — so the TMPDIR side of the check must
# measure ``len(os.fsencode(...))``, never ``len(str)`` (a multibyte
# root is longer in bytes than in chars, and an undecodable root
# reaches Python as surrogate-escaped str that bare ``.encode()``

# Optional-dep (h2) hermeticity: tests marked ``upstream_forward``
# drive a real relayed request through the dispatcher's
# upstream-forwarding leg. That leg builds its httpx clients with
# ``http2=http2_enabled()``, and when the operator has opted into
# HTTP/2 (RAPTOR_HTTP2) the h2 probe behind that flag runs INSIDE
# the relay thread on first forward: on a runner where the ``h2``
# package is unavailable (hidden by a lean-environment meta_path
# blocker, or present-but-broken so ``find_spec``/``import h2``
# raises) the relay thread dies mid-request and the client side of
# the test fails with a RemoteProtocolError — an error, where a
# missing OPTIONAL dependency must produce a skip.
#
# The gate is CONDITIONAL on the opt-in, in both directions:
#
# * opted in + h2 unavailable → skip (reason names h2). Running
#   would error inside the server thread, never a clean failure.
# * no opt-in → run, even with h2 absent. ``http2_enabled()``
#   returns False before ever touching h2, the leg speaks HTTP/1.1,
#   and CI runners — which deliberately do not install h2
#   (requirements.txt ships the pin commented out) — must keep
#   their full relay coverage. An unconditional importorskip here
#   would silently drop all marked tests from every CI lane.
#
# The truthy set below mirrors core.llm.http_pool.http2_enabled()'s
# env parse (the operator contract documented in docs/llm.md); we
# cannot call http2_enabled() itself because it deliberately
# reports False for exactly the opted-in-but-h2-missing case this
# gate exists to intercept. If http2_enabled() grows a new truthy
# spelling, add it here; if a value is retired, drop it here.
