"""Tests for the dispatcher's pooled forwarding-leg clients.

The forwarding leg used to build a fresh ``httpx.Client`` per
request, paying a full TCP + TLS handshake (and, behind chained
proxies, CONNECT negotiation per hop) on every forwarded LLM call.
The dispatcher now owns a small shard pool of clients
(``core.llm.http_pool.ClientShards`` — one shard with HTTP/2 off,
several under HTTP/2 so one multiplexed-connection loss cannot abort
every in-flight relay), keyed on the proxy env (httpx resolves proxy
routes at client construction, and the egress chokepoint mutates
HTTPS_PROXY in-process after the dispatcher may already exist).
Requests pass their timeout per-call so the
``RAPTOR_LLM_DISPATCHER_UPSTREAM_TIMEOUT_S`` knob keeps per-request
semantics.
