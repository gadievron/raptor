"""Regression tests: AF_UNIX sun_path budgets measure BYTES, not chars.

The kernel compares the FSENCODED socket path against the sun_path cap
(108 bytes on Linux, including the trailing NUL), so every budget check
must measure ``len(os.fsencode(...))``:

* ``len(str)`` undercounts a multibyte root (fewer characters than
  bytes), admitting roots whose socket paths later fail ``bind()``;
* bare ``str.encode()`` crashes (``UnicodeEncodeError``) on a root
  carrying undecodable bytes, which reach Python as surrogate-escaped
  ``str``.

This module covers the ``_af_unix_safe_tmp`` re-rooting fixture in
this directory's conftest plus the exact-value boundary of the
runtime budget (``test_sun_path_budget_exact_value``); the rest of
the runtime side (``LLMDispatcher``'s own /tmp fallback) is pinned in
``test_lifecycle.py::TestSocketPathBudget``.
