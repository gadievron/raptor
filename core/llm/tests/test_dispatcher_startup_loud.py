"""Pin that ``raptor._get_or_start_dispatcher`` surfaces failures.

The dispatcher's startup failure used to be a silent
``logger.warning`` that operators would only see if they had
log-level configured. The failure now feeds the env-direct downgrade
announcement: ``_get_or_start_dispatcher`` records WHY it failed in
``raptor._dispatcher_failure_reason``, and the single prominent
operator-facing banner (naming the credential-isolation downgrade +
that reason) prints at the fallback site in ``_run_script`` — pinned
in ``core/run/tests/test_env_direct_downgrade_banner.py``.
