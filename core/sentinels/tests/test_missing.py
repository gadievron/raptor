"""Tests for the reload-stable ``MISSING`` sentinel.

The reason this module exists at ``core/sentinels/`` (not under
``core/json/*``) is to survive ``sys.modules`` resets in
``core/json/tests/test_f046_lazy_reexports.py``. These tests pin
that contract: singleton identity, ``bool(MISSING) is False``,
survival across a sub-package reload, and a ``repr`` that names
the sentinel's actual location.
