"""Shared run-digest reader + renderers.

ONE reader over a run directory's existing artifacts, consumed by both
operator introspection surfaces so they can never drift apart:

* ``raptor-run-status`` — read-only LIVE view of a run (phase,
  heartbeat age, spend vs cap, breaker/retry counts);
* the end-of-run digest — the ranked "what matters" summary printed at
  /agentic completion and served by ``raptor-review digest``.

Artifacts read (all optional — every layer degrades to absent):

* ``.raptor-run.json`` via :func:`core.run.metadata.load_run_metadata`
  (status / timestamps / ``extra`` counters / error);
* ``llm-telemetry.jsonl`` via the bounded JSONL reader (call /
  failed-attempt / breaker-trip counters, live cost sum, last event);
* ``cost-breakdown.json`` + ``spend-floor.json`` + the journal floor
  via :func:`core.audit.resume.resolve_prior_spend`, and the run's cap
  from ``audit-run-config.json`` where one exists;
* findings artifacts via
  :func:`core.project.findings_utils.load_findings_from_dir` +
  tri-state verdict reads (:mod:`core.run.finding_status`);
* oracle-verified outcomes via
  :func:`core.labeled_attempts.view.collect_outcomes`;
* ``suppressions.jsonl`` counts;
* the coverage store view (:mod:`core.coverage.store_summary`);
* deferred-tail operator hints via
  :func:`core.audit.resume.pipeline_tail_hint`.

Heartbeat is the existing mtime convention (there is no heartbeat
file): the freshest mtime across the run dir and its immediate
children, bounded — appenders like the telemetry sink and the journal
touch the dir's children on every event.

Every value read here comes out of the sandbox-writable run dir —
attacker bytes. The reader keeps them raw (JSON consumers get exact
values); the RENDERERS in this module escape at render
(``core.security.log_sanitisation``) before any terminal output, so
CLIs printing these strings verbatim stay inside the audited-writer
contract.
