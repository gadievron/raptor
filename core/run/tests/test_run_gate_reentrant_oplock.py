"""Re-entrant run starts queue behind the project ``.op.lock``.

Defect: ``_project_run_gate``'s re-entrant arm — a start_run on a dir
whose OWN metadata already reads ``status=running`` (the documented
enrichment flows, but equally a crashed-run-dir restart into the same
output dir) — yielded immediately, skipping the flock entirely. The
journal reindex sweep holds ``.op.lock`` for its whole duration
precisely so run starts queue behind it; the re-entrant shape was the
one start class that still wrote mid-sweep behind the sweep's back.

Fix under test: the re-entrant arm acquires the op lock with the same
``wait=True`` posture as a fresh start and holds it across its yield
(the metadata read-modify-write window). It still skips the SIBLING
contention refusal — gating an enrichment against siblings could kill
a run whose parent already passed the gate — and the lock order is
unchanged (``.op.lock`` outermost, then the metadata lock).

Determinism: flock(2) locks belong to the open file description, so a
fresh ``os.open`` of the lock path IN THIS PROCESS contends for real —
the probes observe held/free state at exact points. The one bounded
wait below guards a direction that must not happen (entering the
gate while the lock is held), not a synchronization point.
