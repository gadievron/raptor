"""Tests for core.run.parent_liveness — the in-child orphan watchdog.

Unit layer: arm/disarm decisions and the ppid-change trigger, with the
group-kill action stubbed (a real ``killpg(0, SIGKILL)`` would take the
test session down). E2E layer: a real parent/child/grandchild process
tree under a hard parent SIGKILL, asserting the whole child group exits
within a bounded window — every process involved is spawned by the
test, in its own session, and reaped in ``finally``.
