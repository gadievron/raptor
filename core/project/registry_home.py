"""Single resolution seam for the operator-registry locations.

Three user-level operator registries share one location contract:

* the projects registry (``~/.raptor/projects`` — project JSON files),
* the last-activated bookmark (``<projects>/.active`` symlink),
* the sessions registry (``~/.local/share/raptor/sessions.d`` —
  session bindings, run ledgers, pin witnesses, ledger locks).

Session binding, the ``.active`` default, and ledger locking all key
on these being ONE shared set of locations for every consumer in the
process tree. Historically each consumer computed its own copy at
IMPORT time (``core.project.project.PROJECTS_DIR``,
``core.project.sessions.SESSIONS_DIR``, ``core.startup``'s
``PROJECTS_DIR``/``ACTIVE_LINK``), so an env-less product misuse or a
conftest-less test extract resolved the REAL home with no override
seam. This module is the single call-time resolver every consumer
derives from — Python (this module), the launcher's session seeder
(``bin/raptor``) and the coverage read hook
(``plugins/coverage/libexec/raptor-hook-read``) honour the same
contract in bash.

Override: ``RAPTOR_REGISTRY_HOME=<absolute dir>`` relocates ALL of
them together — ``<dir>/projects``, ``<dir>/projects/.active`` and
``<dir>/sessions.d`` — so the shared-location contract cannot split.
A non-absolute value (including a literal ``~`` — the bash consumers
cannot expand one, and the shell already expands it at export time)
is refused loudly: a cwd-relative registry would silently wander with
the process's cwd — the exact defect class this seam removes. Unset
or empty means the byte-identical historical defaults above, so
existing operator state keeps working.

Resolution is deliberately UNCACHED: every call re-reads the env, so
a consumer reading at call time sees a mid-process override change
(test harnesses re-point the registry per test) and never a stale
copy. The reads are two ``os.environ`` lookups and a couple of Path
joins — not worth a cache that could pin a torn value.

Import weight: stdlib-only. Keep it that way — ``core.startup``'s
light readers reach this module at call time.
