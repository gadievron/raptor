"""Hardened, size-capped file read for config/trust scanners.

Owns the open-flags dance the CC-side and CodeQL-side trust scanners
previously each carried a private copy of. The cap stays with the
caller (the two scanners historically chose different limits), the
hardening lives here once.

Two axes of caller policy are parametrized so consumers with a
different ERROR CONTRACT (raise vs None) or SYMLINK STANCE (an
operator-named path may legitimately be a symlink) can still share
the one hardened dance instead of re-deriving it:

  * ``raise_on_refusal=True`` propagates the open/read ``OSError``
    and raises :class:`CappedReadRefused` (a ``ValueError``) on
    policy refusals — for callers whose degradation path is an
    exception handler rather than a ``None`` check.
  * ``follow_symlinks=True`` drops ``O_NOFOLLOW`` — ONLY for paths
    the operator named explicitly; target-controlled paths must keep
    the default refusal.

:func:`read_capped_text` layers the UTF-8 ``errors="replace"``
decode the text-consuming callers (build-config and manifest
parsers) all repeated.

    O_NONBLOCK + fstat(S_ISREG) closes the FIFO-DoS and stat-vs-open
    TOCTOU holes. O_NOFOLLOW closes the symlink-redirect hole — the

    without reading them, but a TOCTOU race could swap a regular file
    for a symlink between that check and the open here; with
    O_NOFOLLOW the open fails with ELOOP. O_CLOEXEC keeps the fd from
    leaking across an unrelated concurrent exec. The fstat size gate
    refuses an over-cap file BEFORE any bytes are read (a planted
    multi-GiB blob must not cost a cap-sized read to refuse), and the
