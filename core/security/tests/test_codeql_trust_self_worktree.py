"""Worktree-of-self recognition in the codeql trust gate's self-skip.

The self-scan skip in ``core.security.codeql_trust._scan_repo`` must
treat a git worktree REGISTERED IN RAPTOR'S OWN GIT METADATA as self
(same trust domain as ``_RAPTOR_DIR`` itself), while everything a
hostile target can forge on its own side — a fake ``.git`` back-link
file, a clone squatting a registered path, a symlinked ``.git`` —
stays NOT self, so the normal pack scan (and its refusal) runs.

All fixtures build the registry files by hand (no git binary needed —
the gate reads raw ``.git/worktrees/<name>/gitdir`` files), and
``_RAPTOR_DIR`` is monkeypatched to a tmp fake root: nothing here
depends on the real repo's checkout shape.
