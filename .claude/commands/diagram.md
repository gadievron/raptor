description: Generate Mermaid visual maps from /understand or /validate output directories
dispatch: libexec/raptor-render-diagrams <out-dir> [args]

# /diagram

Turn `/understand` and `/validate` JSON outputs into Mermaid diagrams. Instead of reading raw JSON, you get a visual map of entry points, trust boundaries, sinks, attack trees, and attack paths. Consider this very much a WIP, but it can be of use to those wanting to see relationships and flows better.

Diagrams are auto-generated at the end of `/validate` and `/understand --map`/`--trace`; use `/diagram <dir>` to re-render after manual edits to the JSON outputs.

## Usage

```
/diagram <out-dir> [--target <name>] [--stdout] [--force] [--report-format FORMAT] [--report-output PATH] [--no-report]
```

It renders everything it can find in the directory. Use `--stdout` for a
read-only preview (unless you also request a portable export), or `--force` if you really do want to overwrite an existing
`diagrams.md`.

## What gets rendered

| Source file | Diagram type | Shows |
|-------------|-------------|-------|
| `context-map.json` | flowchart LR | Entry points → trust boundaries → sinks; unchecked flows as dashed edges |
| `attack-surface.json` | flowchart LR | Same layout, Stage B view |
| `flow-trace-*.json` | flowchart TD | Each hop in the call chain, tainted variable at each step, branches, attacker control |
| `attack-tree.json` | flowchart TD | Knowledge graph with nodes styled by status (confirmed/disproven/exploring/unexplored) |
| `attack-paths.json` | flowchart TD per path | Step chain with proximity score (0–10) and blocker annotations |
| `hypotheses.json` | flowchart TD | Hypothesis states |
| `findings.json` | pie | Verdict/type summary (rendered when 2+ findings) |
| `graph/raptor.graph.sqlite` | flowchart LR | Fallback context map from persistent `/understand` graph memory when local JSON is absent |

Black-box binary `context-map.json` files (and `binary-context-map.json`) also render xref-backed candidate call
edges as dotted grey edges labelled `candidate`. They are deliberately not
drawn as unchecked flows because a binary xref is not taint proof.

## Examples

```
# Everything from a /understand run
/diagram out/understand_<timestamp>/

# Include a target name in the header
/diagram out/validate_<timestamp>/ --target myapp

# Print to stdout
/diagram out/understand_<timestamp>/ --stdout
```

## Output

Writes `diagrams.md` into the target directory next to the existing JSON files. One Mermaid fenced block per diagram, with section headings. Renders in GitHub, VS Code, Obsidian, or anything Mermaid-aware.

## Execution

```bash
libexec/raptor-render-diagrams <out-dir> [--target <name>] [--stdout] [--force] [--report-format FORMAT] [--report-output PATH] [--no-report]
```

Forward `$ARGUMENTS`, including the listed switches, to the command. Display its mechanical summary and output paths. Do not spend model calls regenerating or summarising the captured diagrams.

## When to run

After any of:
- `/understand --map` (produces `context-map.json`)
- `/understand --trace <entry>` (produces `flow-trace-*.json`)
- `/validate` (produces `attack-surface.json`, `attack-tree.json`, `attack-paths.json`)

Point it at the same output directory. It picks up whatever JSON is there: no configuration needed.

## Portable exports

`/diagram RUN_DIR --stdout --report-format json` keeps the native preview on
stdout and writes a portable companion. Repeat `--report-format` for Markdown,
JSON or XML outputs; multiple formats need a directory destination. The companion
freezes Mermaid source, textual fallbacks, provenance and section warnings from
the same render. It can be rendered offline after original inputs change.

`--no-report` disables portable companions, while retaining the command's native
diagram output. `--force` still applies to an existing native `diagrams.md`; it
does not permit a report destination to replace source JSON or graph data.

Large native output can yield a partial companion. The receipt flags incomplete
capture explicitly; native diagram output remains available.

The CLI prints a mechanical diagram count on stderr even without a portable
export or with `--no-report`. `--stdout` remains native Markdown only.

If the companion cannot record all source references, export is declined and
prior portable files stay untouched. The native render and its count remain
available.
