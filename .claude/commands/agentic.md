# /agentic - RAPTOR Full Autonomous Workflow

🤖 **AGENTIC MODE** - This will autonomously:
1. Scan code with Semgrep/CodeQL (parallel)
2. Deduplicate findings
3. Prep findings (read code, extract dataflow)
4. **Validate + analyse** each finding (exploitation-validator methodology, Stages A-D)
5. **Self-review**: catch contradictions, retry low confidence (Stage F)
6. **Consensus**: multi-model second opinion (if `--consensus`)
7. **Judge**: non-blind review of primary reasoning (if `--judge`)
8. **Aggregate**: synthesize multi-model results for downstream use (if `--aggregate`)
9. **Generate exploit PoCs** for exploitable findings
10. **Generate secure patches** for confirmed vulnerabilities
11. **Cross-finding analysis** (structural grouping, shared root causes)

Nothing will be applied to your code - only generated in the out/ directory.

Execute: `libexec/raptor-agentic --repo <path>`

## Optional enrichment flags

By default, `/agentic` scans and analyses findings in isolation. Two optional flags add richer context for more thorough results. They are opt-in because they add time and cost, but if you are doing a proper security review rather than a quick scan, they are well worth it.

| Flag | What it does |
|------|-------------|
| `--understand` | Runs `/understand --map` as a proper sibling run, producing `context-map.json` (entry points, trust boundaries, sinks). Two consumers: (a) the agentic checklist gets priority markers, so per-finding analysis prompts say things like *"Architectural role: entry_point"* — improving in-run analysis; (b) any `/validate` against the same target — including this run's `--validate` post-pass — picks the map up via the bridge. |
| `--validate` | After the agentic pipeline completes, runs `/validate` on findings flagged `is_exploitable: true` or `confidence: "high"`. Creates a sibling validate run; the bridge auto-discovers any `/understand` sibling produced by `--understand`. |

You can use either flag on its own or combine them:

```
# Recommended for thorough reviews — pair both flags
/agentic --understand --validate

# Just enrich this run's analysis with architectural priority markers
/agentic --understand

# Just validate the findings that look exploitable (no pre-mapping)
/agentic --validate
```

Pass both flags straight through to `libexec/raptor-agentic`. The Python layer owns all orchestration and selection logic; you don't need to filter findings or invoke other skills yourself.

## How analysis works

Findings are dispatched for parallel analysis via one of two paths:

- **Claude Code on PATH**: dispatches `claude -p` sub-agents (separate processes)
- **External LLM configured**: dispatches via `generate_structured()` API calls
- **Both available**: uses external LLM, falls back to Claude Code if it fails

Model roles determine which model analyses (analysis), writes code (code),
provides second opinions (consensus), reviews reasoning (judge), and
synthesizes multi-model output for downstream use (aggregate).
See the "Multi-model analysis" section below.

If **neither** is available, the pipeline produces prep-only output. In that case,
**YOU (Claude Code) are the LLM** — the user may ask you to analyse the findings
directly in conversation. See the prep_only report mode below for instructions.

Analysis follows the exploitation-validator methodology (Stages A-D):
- **Stage A**: One-shot verification — is the vulnerability pattern real?
- **Stage B**: Attack path analysis — what are the preconditions and blockers?
- **Stage C**: Sanity check — does the code match? is the flow real? is it reachable?
- **Stage D**: Ruling — test code? unrealistic preconditions? hedging?

If `--binary` is provided, Stage E (binary feasibility analysis) runs before
scanning and its results (chain_breaks, mitigations) are included in each
finding's analysis prompt.

The dispatch pipeline runs these tasks in sequence:

1. **AnalysisTask** — Stages A-D per finding (validation + analysis in one call)
2. **CrossFamilyCheckTask** — re-check suspicious responses via a different model family
3. **RetryTask** — Stage F: self-consistency check, retry contradictions + low confidence
4. **ConsensusTask** — blind second model votes on true positives (if `--consensus`)
5. **JudgeTask** — non-blind review of primary reasoning (if `--judge`)
6. **Correlation** — multi-model agreement matrix + confidence signals (if 2+ `--model`)
7. **AggregationTask** — final synthesis into `aggregation.json` (if `--aggregate`)
8. **ExploitTask** — PoCs for final-verdict exploitable findings
9. **PatchTask** — secure fixes for exploitable findings
10. **GroupAnalysisTask** — cross-finding patterns (shared root cause, attack chaining)

Cost tracking is real-time with adaptive budget cutoff.

## Multi-model analysis

By default, the primary model is auto-detected from `~/.config/raptor/models.json` or API key env vars (GEMINI_API_KEY, ANTHROPIC_API_KEY, OPENAI_API_KEY). Use `--model` to override.

`--model` is repeatable. Multiple models each independently analyse every finding (Stages A-D), then results are correlated — agreement matrix, confidence signals, clusters, unique insights. With 3+ analysis models, `--consensus` is auto-skipped (redundant).

| Flag | Role | What it does |
|------|------|-------------|
| `--model MODEL` (repeatable) | Analysis | Each model independently analyses every finding. Multiple = multi-model correlation. |
| `--consensus MODEL` | Blind second opinion | Re-analyses each finding independently (doesn't see the primary verdict). Majority vote decides the final ruling. Auto-skipped with 3+ `--model`. |
| `--judge MODEL` | Non-blind review | Sees the primary analysis reasoning and critiques it. Flags missed attack paths, flawed logic, or inconsistent verdicts. |
| `--aggregate MODEL` | Final synthesis | Aggregates the multi-model results into `aggregation.json` for later pipeline/reporting use. Requires at least two `--model` values. |

```
# Single model
/agentic --model gemini-2.5-pro

# Multi-model — each analyses independently, results correlated
/agentic --model gemini-2.5-pro --model gpt-5 --model claude-opus-4-6

# Multi-model + downstream aggregation
/agentic --model claude-opus-4-6 --model gpt-5.4 --aggregate claude-sonnet-4-6

# Single model + consensus + judge
/agentic --model gemini-2.5-pro --consensus gpt-5.4 --judge claude-opus-4-6
```

Roles can also be set permanently in `models.json` instead of CLI flags.

## Report modes

The pipeline produces a report with one of three modes:

**`"mode": "prep_only"`** — No LLM was available and orchestration did not run.
The pipeline completed scanning, SARIF parsing, deduplication, code reading,
dataflow extraction, and structured output — but no analysis. Read the findings
from `autonomous_analysis_report.json` in the output directory. Each finding
includes `code`, `surrounding_context`, `file_path`, line numbers, `dataflow`,
and `feasibility`. If the user asks you to analyse them, for each finding:

1. **Analyse** — is it a true positive? Is it exploitable? What's the attack scenario?
2. **Generate exploit PoCs** for exploitable findings
3. **Generate secure patches** for confirmed vulnerabilities

Do NOT include raw code from the findings in sub-agent prompts — let each agent
read the code itself via the Read tool.

**`"mode": "full"`** — An external LLM performed sequential analysis (when
`--sequential` was used or Claude Code was not available). Present the results.

**`"mode": "orchestrated"`** — Parallel analysis via external LLM or Claude Code
sub-agents. Results include per-finding `analysed_by` (which model), `cost_usd`,
`duration_seconds`, plus `cross_finding_groups` and optional `consensus`,
`judge` metadata. Present the results to the user.

In all modes, findings are in the `results` array of the report. Orchestrated
and full mode findings include `is_exploitable`, `reasoning`, `exploit_code`, and
`patch_code` fields. Prep-only findings include `code`, `surrounding_context`,
`dataflow`, and `feasibility` for review.

**After the pipeline completes**, read `agentic-report.md` from the output directory
and add a 1-2 sentence summary paragraph after the `# RAPTOR Agentic Security Report`
header — e.g., "Scanned 26 findings across 10 C files. 8 are exploitable buffer overflows
and command injections; 2 were ruled out as false positives." Use only facts from the
report data. The report should stand on its own without this paragraph.
