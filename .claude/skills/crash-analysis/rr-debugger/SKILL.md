# rr Deterministic Debugger

rr provides deterministic record-replay debugging with full reverse execution capabilities.

## Core Workflow

1. **Record**: `rr record <program> [args]`

   **Sandbox exemption (documented decision):** rr needs `ptrace` and perf counters, which `libexec/raptor-run-sandboxed` denies, so recording runs the untrusted binary unsandboxed — behavior observed under earlier sandboxed runs says nothing about what the payload does with this ambient authority. Keep the recorded invocation to exactly the reproduced crash command (never a broader test suite or build), and treat any unexpected network or filesystem activity during recording as a finding in itself. Replay carries no such residual: it re-executes the recorded trace under gdb, not the binary against the host.
2. **Replay**: `python3 -I "$RAPTOR_DIR/.claude/skills/crash-analysis/rr-debugger/scripts/crash_trace.py" --interactive` opens GDB with reverse execution inside RAPTOR's dedicated rr sandbox. It requires a packed recording, Linux mount/PID/network namespaces and seccomp. The launcher disables GDB initialization and automatic symbol scripts before loading the recording. Use it for interactive and automated replay; never retry outside containment after refusal.

## Reverse Execution Commands

All standard gdb commands work, plus reverse variants:

- `reverse-next` / `rn`: Step back over function calls
- `reverse-step` / `rs`: Step back into functions
- `reverse-continue` / `rc`: Continue backward to previous breakpoint
- `reverse-stepi` / `rsi`: Step back one instruction
- `reverse-nexti` / `rni`: Step back over one instruction

## Crash Trace Extraction

### Regular Crashes

After `rr record <crashing-program>`:

```bash
python3 -I "$RAPTOR_DIR/.claude/skills/crash-analysis/rr-debugger/scripts/crash_trace.py" --interactive
# In gdb:
reverse-next 100    # Go back 100 steps (adjust N as needed)
# Now step forward to see execution leading to crash:
next
next
...
```

### ASAN Crashes

After `rr record <asan-program>`:

```bash
python3 -I "$RAPTOR_DIR/.claude/skills/crash-analysis/rr-debugger/scripts/crash_trace.py" --interactive
# In gdb:
bt                  # View stack trace
up                  # Issue "up" commands until last app frame (before ASAN runtime)
break *$pc          # Set breakpoint at that location
reverse-continue    # Go back to last app instruction before ASAN
# Now step forward to see execution leading to fault:
next
next
...
```

## Inspecting Variables and Memory

Standard gdb commands work at any point:

- `print <var>`: Print variable value
- `print *<ptr>`: Dereference pointer
- `x/<format> <address>`: Examine memory
  - `x/10xb <addr>`: 10 bytes in hex
  - `x/s <addr>`: String at address
- `info locals`: Show local variables
- `info args`: Show function arguments

## Source vs Assembly View

- `list`: Show source code around current location
- `disassemble`: Show assembly around current location
- `layout src`: TUI source view
- `layout asm`: TUI assembly view
- `set disassemble-next-line on`: Show assembly with each step

## Automation Script

Use `scripts/crash_trace.py` to automatically extract execution trace before crash.
